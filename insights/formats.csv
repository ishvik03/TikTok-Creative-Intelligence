Definitely give this a try. If you need my help on how to edit this just comment how. And I'll create the future video. 3 fashion hacks especially in the summertime. Scarf shirt pants so many ideas.

"NOT DIRECTLY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE, just want to give y’all sauce & a heads up of what community you’re diving into  hope this video helps you start your journey  #fyp #viral #fashion #fashiontiktok #OOTD #fypツ #fashioninspo #streetwear"," Here is how to be a fashion creator in 2025. I'm gonna teach you how to make some money on boys. It's 2025 and a lot of people are trying to grow their personal brands and their identity. Now, before you become a fashion creator, please understand the community is so toxic. It's a really toxic community, I'm sorry. If you're not wearing tabbies and acne studio jeans, Old Man Jenkins jacket from 1855, you're not him. Ha ha ha. Pretty much cook. However, just wear what you want, because that's all that matter. The rule number one, to making content, you need confidence. Been making content since Vine. Now, I swear if I see uncomments, bro, you're banned. I started making videos since Vine, then I was a YouTuber, then I did Fortnite YouTube, and then I did custom YouTube, and then I'm a tech talker. Ha ha ha. My gosh, brawmwash. Number two, what is the purpose of the video you're even making? Listen, we have seen the people shake their jeans, throw a gang sign and walk off. I used to do it too and did it work out. No, since I started opening my mouth on the platform, yeah, it started working out. It takes us to number three. Have a personality. For my case, people just know me as the one dude that has the crazy laugh and the run-your-banz method. Now, I don't do the run-your-banz method, and I'm, I don't feel like a thing and I do. Gosh, dude, I ship out my orders, dude. I shipped everything out yesterday. Before, bro, you need quality tools to make the content. The DJI microphone. This is not sponsored. How much is it? Oh man. Ha ha ha. Prepare to take out something in your grilled cart, buddy, because this microphone's 160. It really is worth it. And on top of that, with the content you're making, you're gonna make it back. Next up, tripod would ring like Amazon. Next thing you need is a background. Now, my background is just me. This is literally just me as a wall. And then obviously, you need your phone. I have an iPhone 14 Pro. I also switched off the front mirror. Which pretty much means you can read this right now. Lastly, what I used to edit with is CapCut. Number five, you need to be consistent. Gotta at least upload a video every single day. I'm even twice a day. Make sure whatever you put on TikTok, you're also putting on Instagram Reels. Might as well grow both platforms. Lastly, please just have fun. Make content because you actually enjoy it. A lot of people are so driven by money. The money's gonna come as long as you're passionate. Also, be careful with a lot of these influencers that you wanna make friends with. A lot of them are not who you really think they are. This is not direct shade towards nobody. But I'm not gonna lie, the fashion community is pretty toxic. And a lot of these people have egos for wearing clothes. I still to this day will never understand. I want you to have an ego for wearing clothes. Like, bap!

#fashiondesigner #fashiontiktok #artistsoftiktok #metgala #sewing #artist"," Growing up I always believed that being an artist was not a full-time career. I always cared about the wrong things and I always cared way too much about fitting in and I didn't fully believe in myself that I would be able to become a full-time artist. In the past like six months literally all of that has changed. I don't give a fuck about what anyone thinks. What's up I'm Jacelle and I'm 20 years old and I am a full-time artist and fashion designer. During high school is when I started taking art very seriously. I would make things every single day. It was all I could think about and I even got into fashion and I started taking that incredibly serious too and I was learning how to sew and I was signing up for all these classes to perfect my skills and I started making all these dresses and I was selling prom dresses and I can make sewing suits and do all these things because I thought I couldn't pursue art even though that's what I love most. I was like okay the fashion industry has a bunch of jobs and I know I'm good at it so I'm gonna go to fashion school and pray that that leads me somewhere right. So I moved to Paris and I went to fashion school there and I really enjoyed my time in Paris that was fun but the school itself I did not enjoy and I learned very quickly actually that the fashion industry just is not for me. So I dropped out of fashion school and I moved back to California and I just started taking community college classes, all art classes. I started posting on social media and I just became super consistent with that and now everything's changed and I'm doing this full time and I'm paying for my own art studio and it's insane. A director from when I was a kid doing theater reached out to me and was like hey do you want to come cost and design Shrek and I was like hell yeah why not and then ever since there I've just been designing shows I did Fiddler on the roof and then the Adams family and I'm deciding what shows I want to do next. Some world the story I've literally no idea what I'm actually doing but I'm just doing what I love trying to figure out and turn it into my career so literally follow along because I'm gonna be sharing every single step of the way.",tutorial,UK,True

a lot of you guys ask me how I got started so here’s my story. Let me know what else you want to know ✨ #grwm #storytime #fashion," how I became successful in the fashion and stream and as a business woman. I actually went to fashion school, but to note, you do not have to go to fashion school in order to be in fashion. Actually, I was a worst student. I never showed up for class. But I interned a lot and I assisted a lot of people so I can learn the skill. Basically, I was in halfway in Devilware's Prada, but I was getting paid at all. And while I was interning, I also started my blog. I don't want to wait for an opportunity. I just wanted to create something for myself. And keep in mind that no one was really blogging back then. This was 15 years ago. It was just weird to have a blog. It was really just a passion of mine and a way for me to just release my creative outlet because I just loved fashion so, so much. And then I started on my YouTube channel as well. Back then, there was no one doing fashion tutorials. It was only kind of beauty videos that you saw online. So I was actually one of the first fashion gurus on YouTube. I was still in college back then. And honestly, I didn't just for fun. I didn't expect to make any money from it. But it was actually during that time when people were starting to take notice of, quote unquote, influencers. We were not called influencers back then. I think we're called like YouTubers and bloggers. So while I was in college, I would just be consistently posting videos. So after my classes, I would film videos and all of a sudden, one day, a brand reached out to me and they wanted to pay me to create a video. And for me, I was so confused. I was like, why did they want to pay me? Maybe a year into creating content. I made my very first paycheck. It was small, but I was so excited. So I gave myself a deadline. I'm gonna give myself a year to save as much money as I can to not have to work and to create context. I just love creating content. So after a year, I did that. I was able to make enough money where I didn't have to actually go get a job. And so I told my parents, I pressed it, I was crazy. But the most important thing that I did that made the biggest difference was when I got paid, I actually used that money and invested it back into my business. I actually hired people to help me to create more content. And I honestly think that was one of the reasons why I became very successful is instead of like going out there and buying like the newest itbath, I actually invested it into people. I mean, I'm telling you guys that we were a content machine back then. And my secret weapon was really my team. So the biggest lesson here is not just to make money, but when you make money, how are you gonna invest that back into your business so it could catapult you? Back then, no one cared about influencers. They thought we were joke. But 13 years later, here I am. It's a matter of being creative. The guests are the box would also be persistent and just sticking with it and not giving up. So let me know what you guys want to hear more about. All right, bye guys.",talking_head,UK,False
The fashion space is a tricky tricky B word! #TikTokShop #AffiliateMarketing #TikTokAffiliate #SocialMediaMarketing #AffiliateTips #TikTokTips #fashioncreator," I've made almost $400,000, maybe more than $400,000 as a TikTok affiliate. Most of my GMV, most of my sales and most of my income, come from fashion, like clothing. And on our coaching call last night, by the way, we're getting unready together. On our coaching call last night, her profits Academy, and we had a group coaching call, and a lot of people wanted to talk about fashion and how to successfully do it because a lot of people were struggling with fashion and posting about clothes. And I just so happen to be, I don't wanna say I'm an expert, but again, I've had a lot of success with clothes. And I'm gonna say this, I'm gonna hold your hand and say it. If the clothes are basic and the clothes are meh, something you can get on the shelves at Walmart, if it's super, super basic, without having anything about it that's special, it just isn't gonna do well. And if the product itself is boring, or not that attractive, or like I said, meh, it isn't gonna do well, it's just not gonna sell. Remember Bestie, it's social media. If it isn't very exciting, there's nothing unique about it. It's just the striped sweater with nothing unique about it, not extra flattering, not extra unique. It's not gonna do well. Social media, like when you start off a video, you need a hook. When you start off a video, you need something to get someone's attention in the fashion space, it comes down to visuals. It comes down to whether or not people give a damn about the sweater. And if it's a basic ass sweater, then anybody can get from anywhere, it just isn't gonna do well. Okay, so how do we remedy this problem? Because like, are we all fashion designers, and can we all just pick the best top fashion that's gonna sell really well? No, even I, somebody who has always gotten compliments about my clothes, it has always done well in the sense of fashion, has a really good keen eye for it. I still have to check these check boxes. So again, as somebody who's made hundreds of thousands of dollars from this app, specifically in fashion, I'm gonna give you my check boxes, what I check off in terms of how I do this, and how I rock the fashion space. Okay, it's not about hooks, it's not about how gorgeous you look, has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with the aesthetic of your house. It's all about the product selection. I guess I'm giving you advice with bad lighting, but I ran out of time today to give you advice. Check box number one. Does the product have a lot of sales already? You need to check the sales. How many sales are we looking for? Nothing under a thousand, especially if you're a new creator, because if it's under a thousand chances are, unless it's brand new, chances are it's another nothing great about it, nothing unique, nothing special. Okay, if it's high sales, and it's fairly new, right, within the last six months, then it's a go, because a lot of people found it interesting, a lot of people liked it, and a lot of people wanted it. So that's what you're gonna do. You're gonna look for the things that have high sales. I sometimes even look for things in the 10,000s, 20,000 range, 15,000, 5,000, anything below that we're risking our, you know, we're kind of taking a risk in a chance. Again, this is if you're new. If you are already big in TikTok, you've got a big following, you've got a big TikTok shop presence, and you've done really well, you may be able to make a new product that's never gone viral, you could make it go viral. But the rest of us have to operate on strategy, because we have a limited amount of time, and a limited amount of resources, so we have to work with what we have, and we don't have all the money in the world by all these clothes. So our limited samples and our limited amount of clothes, we have to choose wisely. So don't waste your time. Just do the ones that are viral. There are plenty, and how do you know if it's newer? On the newer side, it's not like two plus years old, or over seven months old. Go and look at the videos that were already created about it. If it's viral, there will be videos at the bottom, learn from creators. Anybody viral yet? Okay, great. Look at their video, what's the date on it? There is a threshold, and a fine line, because it can be two viral. Like over 30,000, and tons and tons of viral videos, and it's been on the TikTok shop for months and months and months, then it's likely an oversaturated situation. And yes, it is possible to be oversaturated on TikTok shop. I've talked to TikTok shop, or TikTok star creator program directly, and ask that question. And the answer is yes, you can, in fact, be oversaturated. So there's a little bit of an art to this. Okay, also, next, is it cute to you? You have to like it and be excited about it, because if you think you look like a clown in it, or if you think you could not get a fit it right, and it looks stupid on you, no sense. But you have to like it, right? If you look in the mirror and you go, I look stupid, and then everyone else that loves you says so too. They're like, girl, you look, no, that's not your thing. Then don't do it, because if you come out looking like Bozo, the clown in your mind, you're gonna act like you look like Bozo, the clown when you're talking about the product. There's really so much more I could go into, but those are the basics. That's the necessities. If you need help with TikTok shop, you need help with growing learning TikTok shop.

Make sure that your fits are at the best quality possible and that you're putting an effort into each fit. It may be slow at first, but after a while, you'll start to get recognized. And if you all want a quality tutorial, check out my TikTok page. Second thing you need to do is be consistent. Make sure you're posting fits regularly and that you're posting on your story daily. I would recommend posting a fit every week or every two weeks. Make sure to post on TikTok too, because all your TikTok followers are gonna come and support you on Instagram. The third thing you need to do is show support to other people. Make sure you're consistently liking, commenting, and reposting all your mutuals content no matter what type of content they do. Being genuine and showing support to other people is gonna take you a long way. Also, don't be gay keeping and try to help other people if they ask for it.

My 5-9 as a Fashion Influencer! This is work okayyy lol but we’ve got plans & goals so it must get done! #fashioninfluencer #fashiontok #howtobeaninfluencer #contentcreator #creatorsearchinsights," You said you wanted to be a fashion influencer, but you don't know where to start. Hey, girls, be my fives. And I would be because we are not full time yet, but the way that we're going, we will be there soon. So I got off work. I did my glam and I'm about to shoot content for YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest and Amazon and LCK. I'm basically filming one video, but with that video, I'm filming other videos as well. So I'll kind of show you all what I mean by that. But I just want to go ahead and start to solve this. It'll kind of be like a nightcap. So let's get started. Now this is what I meant. I'm shooting for multiple platforms. This content you're seeing right here is going to be my short form content. So this is for like TikTok, LCK, Pinterest and Amazon. Okay. Also, I'm checking in. I just filmed kind of like B-roll basically me just doing this for every single outfit. And now I'm going to film the sit down part where I basically showed them the products in a little more detail. And then I have to edit the video, put everything together, but we'll talk about that after I film the sit down part. I wish I would have showed you all this sooner or not before I even plan out a video. I plan on my outfits and I plan them out by going to Canva and making flat lays like this. Later on, I actually can use these supposed on my LCK, my Pinterest and my Amazon. So this is something to consider if you're a fashion influence. And now this next part is what I consider office work. I edit my video, I edit my thumbnail and y'all work smarter and harder. I use chat GPT to give me my title, my tags and all of that good stuff. I then do some work on my Amazon store front, my LCK, all of that stuff. The video is now live. Go give it a wide follow if you enjoyed this and go subscribe to my YouTube. If this is the kind of content you enjoy.",outfit_showcase,UK,False
Step by step on how to increase your income as a fashion content creator #pinterest #ltk," Okay, so I've heard a lot of people also tell me that they don't understand like the money making portion of LTK being an LTK creator. So I think having a system is what works in order to make money with LTK. So when I talk about your social media content, when I talk about Pinterest, when I talk about LTK, they are all interconnected. And this is how your process should go and follow. If you want to ensure that you are making a good amount of money, meaning at least this week now, I think I said like yesterday, I think I'd run $250 or so for the week. Right. And this is me only, I've only posted like twice this week. Okay. So here's the process that I follow that I think works. Okay, because I'm not in a business of why anybody, I post great shots. Okay. So you create your content downloaded from Kafka. Great. You uploaded onto LTK and LTK automatically generates just the link for you. Many of you upload this content to LTK. You link your clothes, also link alternatives. Okay. Even if they don't have the direct links, try as much as possible to link alternatives. When you've done that, you're in your link. Sometimes I use many chat to depend on what kind of thing that I am posting. I use many chat if the brand is not on LTK. But I always think the great way to go is it's LTK because they've now modified where you can actually respond to people because I hit the idea of you just sending a link and now responding back in the comments, which is what many chat have over LTK, but they fix that now. So let me backtrack because I like to talk a lot and go off tangent. I'll upload your content onto LTK, tag all the products, get your link from LTK, upload your content to these all your social media platforms. If it's YouTube, upload it on there. IG, TikTok, whatever it is, threads upload your content on every platform. Right. Now with IG, we all know that if you upload your content and put it in caption, people comment, shop, they automatically get that link. Now the connection between IG and Pinterest that I just talked about is the fact that the moment you upload your content onto IG, it automatically goes on to Pinterest. Right. Now you can either leave it as is, meaning when people go on your Pinterest, they must click that link, it automatically drives them to your Instagram. That's another way to drive traffic. You're doing it like twice, meaning you're uploading a real right where people get to see your content and even if it doesn't reach, you're also uploading it on Pinterest where people get to find your content. People get to find you and see you and there's certain kind of words that you can put in your videos and things like that and we can get into that later. I'm literally going to sit down a longer form of this on YouTube later, but right now I'm just telling you the quick beats and pieces of what you need to know to make sure you're setting up a system that works for you. So we talked about that LCK, grab your link, post it on all your platform, make sure it's linked in your body. I don't understand why else is fashion creators on making people jump through who's to find links. It's 2025. Let's do better than that. Okay. So anyways, once you do that on Pinterest, you can either leave it alone, meaning as you upload on Instagram, it's automatically uploaded on your Pinterest or you can go back on to Pinterest. So as this automatically uploaded for you and changed the link, meaning when people click the link on your Pinterest, they can either choose for them to click the link, they go to Instagram or you can make it super easy for them. Go back on to LCK, not just that link that leads to your LCK, but the link that directly links to the actual website. So meaning if I uploaded this jacket, I did them click in this link and it takes them to my LCK store, which is great because it grows your followership on LCK brand, see you collaborations great, but also you want the final sale, right? You want them to also, you know, purchase the outfit from you or whatever. So what you end up doing is that you take the reward style link that directly links the outfit to the website. You link it to that Pinterest post and let it live, marinate and sit on that website on Pinterest. And I buy the grace of God. And mind you, you guys, I'm a Jesus baby. You guys see Jesus in fashion. I do not do anything. Like even if it's like posted link in fashion, would doubt back in the book God, God is always going to be my source. Okay. It's not by my power, not by my might. I back out the number prayer. Okay. Even if I'm applying to something, if I'm posting a content, whatever it is, I pray really God, you are the master strategist. I can transmit this possible, but you're the one who's going to carry this far and wide. So I have my prayer today. I live it alone. I sleep. I wake up in the morning. I check my accounts. I see how much do we have today. Okay. Great. Last week, we were like one something this week, we're at two something that's already 350. You can make about a thousand dollars a month by doing this. I can let you know that for a fact, you can. So yeah, hope this was understandable. If you want more explanation, let me know. And the next video, I'm going to show you guys my outfit at the end.

Up close & personal today! My biggest tips to grow your fashion brand in 2025  #fashionmarketing #melbournefashion #digitalmarketingtips #digitalagency #ecommerce #ecommercebusiness," If your goal in 2025 is to start your own fashion brand then listen up because I have my top tips that I would be doing if I were starting a fashion brand in 2025. The first is to post the whole journey on TikTok. I think that this is so important and honestly so simple to do but what it's going to do is actually allow people to buy into your journey, buy into the brand even before you have launched. It's so so important these days to be utilizing TikTok. I think more and more people are jumping on there every single month and I know a lot of brands also tell me you know they're a bit too high-end for TikTok and things like that. There are all types of customers on TikTok and I honestly am starting to think that almost every single type of customer or consumer is on TikTok. So my first thing I will be doing is documenting the process on TikTok and showing people exactly why you're building your brand and a bit of a story behind it as well. Next thing is to take the time to get to know your audience or your customer more specifically. Now this sounds really obvious but as a fashion marketing consultant you'd be surprised how many times I hear that people don't actually know their customer at all. It's really important to know your customer down to a tee. If you've seen any of our videos then you know that we hammer on about this all the time so I won't talk about it anymore but just really get to know your customer guys. The next one is to post on organic social media consistently. This also is another one that sounds a little bit obvious but what I would do is I'd choose one platform the main one that your customer is on. So now that you've taken the time to get to know your audience figure out the main platform that they're on and be consistent on posting on that every single day. Now a lot of people say you know do I have to post every single day I'd say do it to maintain consistency. This is something else I've talked about on here as well but consistency is everything so find which platform your customer is on post on there all the time. The next one is selling live on TikTok or Instagram. This can be a little bit daunting and I know that a lot of founders and a lot of people in general don't even like showing up on stories or TikTok let alone selling live but this is such a good way for you to get to know your customer even more and it's such a good way for you to get feedback and talk to them as well as sell your product obviously and by selling live I pretty much just mean jump on Instagram or TikTok live show people different things show them even you just wrapping some orders and things like that but just start talking to them and open up the conversation take on any feedback and they'll sort of get to know you they'll trust you sooner but sooner that they trust you the sooner they get a purchase from you. Now I realize you can pretty much see all the rest but next we've got get social proof this is another important thing in building that trust and social proof also helps you get that authority as well so when people come onto your pages or on your website and they can see that other people that they know or that they don't know wearing your product then they're way more likely to convert so social proof is probably one of my biggest pillars and one of the most important things especially in fashion because it's all around aesthetics it's all around who's wearing what and very trend driven so getting social proof is really important. The next one is optimizing your website now there are so many ways that you can optimize your website and we're just going to give you like a top three things that I would do. The first one is pretty simple make sure your product imagery is really high quality and really really fits your niche make sure that they're going to be really drawn to what your product imagery looks like make sure you've got sizing details right down to whether the product is actually perfect fit if it's slightly oversized those sorts of things people seeing that will really allow them to actually make a purchase decision faster the third thing is probably just to make sure all of your product descriptions are really good for SEO purposes but also so that people can really buy into that product make them a little bit different don't be super boring with your product descriptions just make sure they're optimized and they've got all the information that someone needs to make in order. The next one is make your customer experience incredible so when you are starting a business you have all the time in the world to make sure that every order is packed so precisely it's packed with love they've got a handwritten note they receive it in really quick timing like you've got ample time to be able to make every single customer's experience amazing so I would be focusing on that a lot but the customer experience isn't just about opening the order and things like that it's also from that customer service you provide if they ask a question it's interacting with them it's the email flow that they get afterwards which also goes into my next point. I would be building out all of your email flows and your website pop up. This one at the start I hear a lot of start-ups sort of say to me I don't feel like I need to invest any time into email marketing right now because my list is so small don't think like that you need to start that right now because that's what's going to help you get return customers in the long run but it's also what's going to take time to build and if you don't start now and you start later you're just delaying that process of being able to make money from email marketing when I tell you that email marketing is like one of the biggest revenue drivers for a lot of our clients please believe me because when you put the timing to building your email list nurturing them having your flows and everything set up it's pretty much like almost like passive income so please please build out your email flows and build out your pop up so that people can actually sign up to your emails. I would also be using a lot of smaller content creators and influencers. Now a lot of people say that like influencer marketing is dead and all these sorts of things I definitely think in the last few years things have absolutely changed but what influences are great for again is that social proof so you really want people to be seen in your product and I'd be engaging with a lot of them either just exchanging for gifting I don't know how many actually still do that these days but if they do then absolutely utilize that because they're trying to grow oftentimes and so are you so just utilize a lot of different creators to weigh your pieces take videos take photos post on their socials and then post them on yours it's pretty much what I said by getting social proof. The next one is heroing your customers talk to them talk about them on social media and to build a community it's really engaged in your story and what your brand is about this is one of my biggest tips for 2025 I feel like community is coming back and community is everything so if you can talk to your customers in the DMs or if you can talk to them in comments or on TikTok and then talk about them to the rest of your community then what you're doing is you're again building social proof but you're also creating a bit of a club around your brand so that's something that I would be really really focused on in 2025 but I hope you have enjoyed this list and I hope that for anybody fashion founders out there that this really helps you out.",tutorial,UK,False

"how @Wisdom Kaye became one of the best fashioncreators of our generation (pls someone call the metgala bc not inviting him IS CRAZZYYYY) 

#personalbrand #contentcreators #fashioncreator #socialmediagrowth #influencer"," Wisdom came when for making fashion TikToks in his room to being called the best dress guy on TikTok, according to Vogue, we need to dissect this personal brand and what makes him one of the best fashion creators of our generation. But first things first, give me one good reason why he wasn't invited to this year's Met Gala. Ah, yeah, there's no good reason. Okay, onto the content. You don't need to be a social media strategist to know that he creates visual value. He treats content like art and not just silly little videos. Every video is cinematic, stylized, intentional. He creates content worth watching beyond the trends. And he really makes his own style, not just the way that he styles his outfits, but his actual personal style when it comes to the way he wants his content to be filmed. I did it to produce, he makes that the forefront of all of his content. Good content takes effort and he is putting everything he has in every single video. Second thing he didn't wait. At the beginning of his career, there was a big gap. There wasn't a lot of male fashion content creators and he even said on his spam account that if he was to start creating content now, it would be way harder for him to grow. So basically waiting is the enemy. Like so many creators wait to post, they post the drafts, they don't want to post too many business owners, wait to take action on that idea. Like could you imagine what his career would be like if he waited just even waiting a few months could have completely changed the trajectory of his career? The other thing that he does so well, that a lot of season creators actually have a hard time doing is balancing aspiration and related ability on the scale. You fall under either being more aspiration forward or more relatability forward. Now if you look at his content, he is more aspiration forward. He leans on the side of aspiration. His content, the production, the brands that he's working with, they are more aspirational in nature, but he does such a good job with still being likable and relatable despite the aspirational like quality of his content. And we especially can see this on his second account, which brings me to my next point and my last point, which is I think more creators for their own sanity need to have a spam account. Like we know this on Instagram, it's been says a lot of YouTubers will have like a vlog or a lifestyle account, but even for TikTok, I think especially if you're a creative person with a lot of ideas, you could literally just have so many ideas that brings you into this like paralysis of not knowing what to post because you have so many ideas. So if you have one account that is very focused has a very specific strategy, very specific goal, very specific brand, have your second account that you can just play and have fun and just do anything that you want just to get that creative energy out there without it being so chaotic and so confusing all on one page.

I made my first rookie mistake… #fashion #mistake," I just made my first rookie mistake as a fashion creator. I called a pair of cargo shorts some jords, bro. My fault, bro. I know they're not jords. Honestly, don't even know why I said jords, bro. Because I need a pair of actual jords. Y'all flame me so much. I even had to change the fit. But I know you see it, though. Nice little clean, white and black fit. We just got the standard white tee. Paired that up with the pier wisdom pants. Hey, what y'all know about it? I'm about to get the lugo tatted. So that's gonna make me lock in on the journey. But one thing, though, I'm gonna need y'all to follow me on that journey. One way you could support is by dropping a follow on my Instagram. That's at pier wisdom clothing. And for the kicks, we got these new balance, five fifties. Y'all know I had to throw on the white socks crossbody. And we were in the chains for the accessories. Got the earrings in. And we got the Steve Madden watch. It's actually a nice day outside. It's just raining. So I don't even have to wear a hoodie today. And with that being said, it's the man, dev. You can catch me on TikTok at the man, dev or you can slide to my Instagram at dev.pwc. And if you're really messing with the boy, hit up my YouTube at the man, dev one.

Common mistakes for fashion designer - colours #fyp #fashiondesigner #clothingbrandtips #fashiontiktok #fypage #fashiontok #yapping #fashiondesignertips," Common mistakes that I've seen fashion designers do is that when they're designing, when they're sending tech packs to manufacturers, they are designing on illustrator or in design. They don't convert RGB to CMYK. So RGB is for digital colours and CMYK is for printed colours. So work that is going to be printed. So like your posters, your tech packs are going to get printed. When you send your tech pack to manufacturer, the colours on their screen is a lot more different. And most of the time they're using old computers and when they get your tech pack, they usually print it out. They don't walk around the factory with a computer. So they print it out. So I see a lot of mistakes that people do is that and this could save you like hundreds or if not thousands of depending on your sample process. So I see a lot of people when they convert the colours, the hex codes from the RGB to the parent tones. But what you're meant to do you're supposed to convert the CMYK to the parent tones. So when you use CMYK, it's a lot more better because like some of these manufacturers, when you send out your tech pack, they don't really have the parent tones. They don't have those specific pantones. That's why it's depending on the manufacturer that you're working with. So they try to, when they print out your tech pack, they try to match those colours, the CMYK to the best colour that they do have. So that's why you see like when you get your samples, you're like, why is it totally different? Like even this poster I have behind me, like I designed this poster right here. So the first time when I did it, I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I didn't convert the colours to CMYK. So the red there was a lot more, it was kind of a lot more darker. So when I actually changed, when I did the second print and I changed it to CMYK, I got more when I could recall. So that's why it's really important and that's what it also plays when it comes to clothes. So because they don't really have those, sometimes they might not really have those pantones. So those are the common mistakes that I've seen people make. Because if that simple change can really save you hundreds of dollars or if not thousands. But if you guys want an in-depth tutorial on how to do that, make sure you guys follow me and let me know in the comments and I'll make a video real quick about it.",tutorial,UK,False
"biggest fashion mistakes Camilo and Maya wish they knew from the start 

#fashiontiktok #fashion #fashiontips #stylingtips"," Fash your mistakes, we wish we knew sooner because we've all been there done that. So you have number one stop doing too much. You don't need a statement on every part of your body. You can wear a simple outfit but choose accessorizing as the main feature of your outfit because people will have one thing to focus on instead of being an ISIL. Number two just because your outfits are baggy doesn't mean they look good. You still got to focus on your proportions because you're not trying to look like slim shading the early 2000s. No hate to slim shading though I love you but know your measurements and what suits your body type. Mistake three running with what's only trending because I used to copy and paste whatever was on my few page ending up with hundreds of different styles and aesthetics but none of them being my own. So don't hop on to every single trend and take time for your own personal style. Mistake four washing your jeans.

I MESSED UP!!! So much this year so i thought id be open with you all about it #fashiondesigner #fashionbrandowner #businessowner #businessmistakes #businessfails," I fucked up so much this year, so I thought I would talk about it and try to help others not make the same mistakes as I did with my clothing brand. I'm just going to sit here and be so open and honest, but I thought I would be in a much better position than I am this year. And don't get me wrong, like I look back last year and the brand has grown so much and it makes me really hopeful for next year. I've made so many mistakes that have financially screwed me throughout this whole year. I haven't made making one financial mistake. Really impact things and I've made about 20. I have made way too many mistakes. I bought way too much stock this autumn winter. Like there is absolutely no way I should have bought the stock that I did. Just thought that my brand was on a bit of a roll. My customers are super invested, they're going to come back. I'm really going to build my retention strategy and it just hasn't worked out. It means that I've got so much money to hide up in stock and the stock is set in. I haven't got any stagnant stock that's not moving at all. You shouldn't invest so much of your money in stock all at once. It should be a gradual thing. Even if it is setting, if it's not setting fast enough, you're not getting your return fast enough of cash to then move on to summer. That's where I'm at the minute that I've brought out way too many styles. Unproduct meant that I could literally do this business and run with it because it generated me so much money. I should have learned that a single product can change your brand. It doesn't need to be a whole collection. It can just be like one single hero piece and you don't need to bring out loads. I'm making this amount a month from one product. Surely if I have like 10 products, then I'm going to make like eight to 10 times the amount. It just doesn't work like that because the way that my consumer shops, I think, is a lot slower than the normal brand's customer. I'm going to buy everything in the collection because they don't have the money to, obviously you're not going to just splash like six, seven hundred pounds on a collection. I've just brought out one hero piece and allowed for restock, etc. And now I'm going to quickly talk about one other thing that's really messed with me and it kind of links to that. Mid-luxury brands, luxury brands online and people just come for the fabric composition, the quality, the how ethical it is, how much they're paying their workers. And I really wanted to make sure that that's not like an attack on my brand. It has been a lot of controversy this year on compositions, etc. And that's why I've been really focusing on finding like new factories that work with amazing fabrics. They are so high quality and they literally are so ethical because of that. I had to complain that the price is now too high. I can't win. When I did my Black Friday sale, it was mega. I could make so much more money if I was a hundred pounds or less, have a lower margin and just like run with it like that. It just makes me think like, but that goes against everything that everyone moans about. And I was really trying to make a difference by like literally like, I'm not talking about someone like older pieces, but like some of this new stuff is like it's wool, it's a hundred percent wool. And you're getting a wool dress for two hundred pounds. If you go on to revolve, a wool dress on revolve will be like three to five hundred pounds, two hundred pounds to a lot of money. But then you can't complain, like you can't complain that things are being made from polyester. The amount that it costs to make that is ridiculous. If I ever want to be on revolve, just to be transparent, I have to sell my stuff two times the amount as wholesale's price. 2.5 times to get the profit that they want plus 20% for that. Yes, the cost price versus the selling price is different. And like if you see that as a value of your, you're making loads per piece. You don't make loads per piece because otherwise I'd be sitting in a mansion and like I know this video is so long and if you're still here then thanks for watching. I could explain more and more about margins, profit, that sort of thing and be super transparent. I just don't think people understand how it works, how operating a business works. Do I not get to get paid for my time and effort and energy? Like I've got acne back because I'm so stressed all the time. I'm so thankful, grateful that this has become my day today. Like I'm sitting in my room, I'm sitting in a room filming a video, like not working a 9 to 5, like it's actually just mind blowing to me. Need people to understand that if you want higher quality and if you want beautiful natural fiber fabrics, if you want people to be paid, that's the price. I've made those choices and then people are like, I don't want to pay that. Like guys, everyone fucking asks for it. I deliver it. You don't want it. Love my customers. Need to find like a new audience that is like really appreciative of that price point and of the brand I'm trying to build. There we go.",talking_head,UK,False

"the 2 most common mistakes from beginner stylists .
#fyp #fashiontiktok"," Here are the two most common mistakes I see beginner stylists make when they first start out. Number one would definitely be over-complicating the outfits that they're putting together. I feel like when you're first starting now and I've done this myself, I feel the need to like rise to an expectation that's not really there, and that expectation being, oh I'm a stylist, it's outfit has to be super creative. Oh I'm a stylist, I really have to show off my taste. Oh I'm a stylist, I can't give this trait forward, answer to the certain look that I'm putting together. And that's absolutely positively not the case. In fact it might even work against you instead of for you. If you have a tailored suit, keep it simple, just go with the Derby. If you're dealing with women's wearing and trying to create an outfit for a night out, maybe just go with a simple heel. I feel like people will come across these outfits I just named and like do a crazy outside the box option. Oh it's a tailored suit, I'm gonna go with like a thong, slipper, and then throw a skirt on top of the trousers and all this, like, brought so unnecessary. Keep it simple, especially when you're first starting out and getting your feet wet into the game. With that being said, that leads me to my second mistake that I see pretty often, which is thinking the fit that you're making is meant for you. Trust and believe me, I know I've made some outfits where it's like, yo this shit is wack, this is not lit, this is not for me, and actually I'm right, it really is not for me. I feel like as a stylist you get so centered within your creativity and all these options and what you want, what your vision is instead of taking a step back and realizing that this alpha die making is for a client or a customer. Take yourself emotions out of the equation and realize that this is for a client or a customer is not meant for you to like, it's not meant for you to enjoy, it's solely based on what the customer or client wants. I really hope this helped and until next time, peace, love, and prosperity.",talking_head,UK,False
The mistakes I’ve learned to fix being a content creator.  Do Part 2?  #howtobeacontentcreator #blackcontentcreators #blackfashioninfluencer," The biggest mistakes you can make when you're being content creator and don't realize Number one, batch your content. A lot of the time people just shoot when and where they just feel like it and you get burnt out easily. Plan a day of the week and you're going to shoot, that is the day you're going to shoot everything for the rest of the week. For me when I had a 9 to 5 job for example, I would just shoot on the weekends and I would post that content during the week when I was at work. Second, lean into your personality. It's very easy to sort of follow people and mimic their ways. You want to try and lean into your own personality. If you get excited with unboxings and excited with your clothes, show that. Don't be ashamed of it. That is what makes you you. And you'll find other people relate to that and they will gravitate to you. Second thing or third thing rather, this is a time suck. Be aware that you need to set aside a lot of time for this to really be able to master it. And the other thing is, you're not really ever going to by the way. It's something you learn as you go along and you're always learning. Remember that.",unknown,UK,False
"5 things that make you look cheap

Number 1 is a wrinkle shirt. Can you wear this and go out? This makes you look on-cap, it makes you look not put together, it makes you look on-tighted. And people will not really compliment you if you are dressed like this. Number 2 is on-capped nails. If you cannot maintain your nail polish, please keep it natural, but make sure it is clean. You can't go out looking like this. It's not cool at all. Number 3 is panty-lines. This is looking very tacky. Your undergarments is not supposed to show. We don't need to see your undergarments, try and buy your colored size. So your undergarments shooting the shirt like this, it makes you look very tacky. It's not cool at all. Before it's dirty teeth. No matter what you wear. No matter how expensive what you wear is, the very minute you open your teeth and your teeth is disdirted. All your levels will just come down. Brush your teeth, maintain your teeth, keep it good or high-dent. When you smell, it smells beautifully. When you talk, people will look at your teeth and they will come. Number 5 is rusty chain handbag. When you notice that your not so expensive handbag is becoming rusty like this. Please stop using it. That's why you need to invest in quality and bags. How can you go out and your car is going to handbag? Are you going to people to regard you or call you some respects? It makes you look cheap and that's not the call for the beautiful finding.

We show tons of content tips, ideas, and editing tutorials on our page. So be sure to follow us if you're not already. Okay, so how to get this angle in this edit. You're gonna wanna prop your phone up on something or use a tripod to make sure the phone is slightly above you. I do suggest a tripod because it's gonna allow you to tilt the phone downwards easier. And then you're just gonna put the lens on 0.5 like this so it gives you that zoomed out fish eye effect. From here, you're just gonna film yourself continuously posing, dancing, whatever you want. You're some different shots and poses I think are unique and would help make the video more eye catching. And now for how to get the edit. Upload the video you just made of yourself doing a bunch of different things on whatever platform you're editing on. I'm using CapCut. From here, you're just going to split the clips you want and delete what you don't. So this clip right here, I love and I wanna make sure I have that in the video. I'm gonna split it in the beginning and scroll to split it again for where I wanted to end. Then I'm gonna delete this footage before that I don't want. And we're just gonna repeat this for all the clips that I want. Split at the beginning, split again for where we wanted to end, delete the before footage.

I mean, simply get paid for being the fashionista that I am. The first thing I'll do is leave with education and fashion tips because people love to learn, right? So I will educate the girlies on different materials, quality of clothing. I want to just do your simple get ready with me videos, although that will be one of my pillars. I will also share what to wear for certain events or certain occasions. For a season approach, I will already be posting content showing the girlies what they should wear for fashion and spoke. I would even do a series like this creator. She talks about repurposing outfits or I'll do a series like What's in My Closet pretty much only wearing what I already have put in pieces together. We also know that the girlies love affordable fashion these days, so I would do something called like styling on a budget. You know, bring my audience along for like a relatable experience, yet still being able to dress to the tee. Now when it comes to monetizing your content, you are going to make sure that you have a shot mind. You're going to make sure that you have a L.T.K. that you are linking every single outfit that you are sharing with your audience. And not only that, you must have a Pinterest, okay? If I was a girl who really wanted to make bank from her fashion content, I will have me a Pinterest and I will post pants like this. I will also share my styling videos repurposing my content from TikTok or Instagram over to Pinterest. And once again, I will be linking every single piece of clothing that I share. That way you can start getting paid through affiliate links. Another thing that I would do is like say I'm a girlie who generally loves just putting pieces together and also helping others. I will have it to where people can reach out to me for a consultation. They can ask me all questions pertaining to fashion, their body type, what looks good on them, what colors look good on them. We have it to where people can see you a budget and you can shop pieces for them. Kind of like an interior designer, but you're literally a virtual fashion assistant. Hmm. I mean, there are so many different ways you can make money as a fashion creator. Also make sure you are tagging these brands that you are wearing and your content as well because you know you have to get the brand deals and partnerships.

I totally get it and you can change that to just a little bit more engagement and a lot more views. #fashioncreator #socialengagement #ContentCreation #contentcreator #socialmediacoach," If you're a fashion creator and you're not using a mirror to show off the products that you're creating, here's how I want you to change that, just a little bit to create interest. Likely already created like a beautiful aesthetic space in your house somewhere where you can film, right? So instead of standing in front of that space, what I want you to do is have a mirror reflecting that space, a full-length mirror, and you stand in front of the mirror and film yourself there. Well, the little bit of a tweak here is that you're going to have to angle your camera so that you can't see the camera and the mirror reflection, but you what you want is you to be standing in front of the mirror so that you can see the back of your outfit, but also the mirror is reflecting that beautiful space that you've put together. I promise if you make this one little tweak, your abuse and engagement will increase.",outfit_showcase,UK,False

#createcontent #fashioncontent #fashioncontentcreator #explore #explorepage #sherpajacket"," Fashion content creators never share their process. Let's change that. Here's how you're gonna create your next three to five fashion content posts seamlessly. Step one, identify your key item. Start with one stand out staple item. Something you love until excited to style like a new Sherpa Co. denim jeans or a crew neck. Step two, create concepts and content ideas around this one staple item. For example, if you just bought a Sherpa Co. you can create one unboxing video and outfit of the day video, a styling for three occasions video, or even styling tips. That's four posts right there. Create as many concepts from this one staple as possible. Step three, build your outfits. Start styling your one staple by creating unique and intentional outfits in congruence with your content ideas. The number of posts determine how many outfits to create. Step four, create a film shot list. Rating a film shot list will save you loads of time and will give you direction with, for each of your concepts, and have a very clear list of how you're gonna film it. Step five, film your content. Use your shot film list as a guide and capture additional creative shots that come to mind. Step six, edit your content. Edit your videos one at a time inside of CapCut. Make sure that each of your videos tells a story, and each clip inside your video flows seamlessly together. Edit your posts one to two days ahead of schedule for less stress. Trust me. Step seven, schedule your posts. Use an editorial calendar to schedule and track your content. Avoid in-app scheduling and post organically on Instagram. Stay active on the app for at least 10 minutes after posting to engage with your audience and respond to comments. And there you go.

"If i were to create a fashion brand today - this is how id do it!

#marketing #branding #creativedirection"," If I were to create a fashion brand today, this is how I do it. First, I'd call it chapters where each collection or chapter has its own story, which is shown through the clothing and accessories. Each chapter is kind of like a level where based on your minimum spend and participation in brand challenges, you climb each chapter. For example, when you just start buying, you can only buy from the chapter one collection. But someone who has a big history of purchases can buy from chapter four. This will create a hype and sort of unattainable feel to the collections higher up, just like a Birken does. Each customer will have a library card to show which chapter or level they are on, and the stores themselves will look like bookstores and libraries. The chapter's fashion shows will be called readings, where the story of each collection is narrated while the clothes and accessories are shown. The packaging will look like books, and they themselves can be used as collectibles. Would you buy from this store? You know I would.",unknown,UK,False

Brand marketing in 2025#clothingbrand #fashionmarketing #brandstrategy #clothingtips #contentcreation #creatorsearchinsights," Here's how to market your brand before you launch in 2025. First, get super clear on who you're even creating for. Think beyond age and gender. Ask yourself, what do they do for fun? Where do they shop? Eat, scroll influences them. The more specific, the better. This will guide every decision you make from your designs to your content. Then you're going to dive into platforms like Pinterest or TikTok to study what's trending in their world. Not just what you like. If your ideal customer wouldn't wear it, post it, or share it, it's probably not the right direction. Next, document everything. I'm talking your sketches, sourcing fabric, unboxing samples, even when you get things wrong. People love being part of a journey, and that feels trust and anticipation before your brand even launches. And lastly, always gut check your content by asking when my customer cares about this. If the answer is yes, post-test view. When people actually see the work, the late nights, the back and forth with manufacturers, the failed samples, the wins, and the losses, they'll root for you. That connection you're building by showing up and being transparent is way more powerful than you think. It turns followers, supporters, and supporters into customers. And rest make the value of bringing people along for the ride, and the sales will flow naturally.",tutorial,UK,False
@LOEWE is really that girl when it comes to unique marketing content. Breaking down 3 social media content strategies they’re crushing! #fashion #marketing #socialmedia #content #socialmediamarketing #tips #strategy #loewe #greenscreenvideo #greenscreen," The way this marketing campaigns are the only marketing campaigns you should be looking at if you're looking for inspiration. I'm Kelsey. I run my own marketing and business development firm. They are doing three things in such a fantastic and original way. You haven't been paying attention. You should be. I'm going to show you why. I show you three things that they're doing that are so well done. If you haven't noticed, you will now. First is UGC and influencer content in a way that's original and strange. It's not your average UGC or influencer content. When it pops up on your page, whether it's on TikTok or Instagram, you pause because it's uniquely Louis Vey and it's uniquely comical or interesting. It backs up their products because Louis Vey is innovative. They're ahead of the curve. They are the cool girl. They are the it brand and their marketing just has to support what they're doing because they're the kind of brand that if you know you know. So really what they're doing is trying to bring in the right person when they find them or when you come across them, you're like, oh, wait, I've heard of them. You already know you know. And I saw this video the first time I died. I was like, this is genius. Unreal. Let me show you. And boss this bag from Louis Vey that my boyfriend got for me. I'm crying because he's so sweet and like so thoughtful. I never would have imagined that he would get me this. This is literally Princess Cheekman that I deserve. Her facial expression. Look how pretty this is. No way. Get me to put on outfits. This is so nice. I'm getting so emotional. How fucking funny is that? But also, what did they accomplish there? So many things. One, they told you it's an aspirational luxury brand. You know it's expensive because she has to treat it as an imaginary brand. Two, she said this is Princess Cheekman. Her boyfriend got it for her because it's clearly a luxury brand. Three, she made it a holiday thing. She put it into people's brains. Oh, this should be a holiday gift. Put it on your holiday gift guide. Four, she put it into men's brains that, oh, if you get this for your boyfriend or your girlfriend, whoever it is that you're going to be gifting, they are going to cry like this because this is the ultimate gift. This is a fantastic piece of marketing. And because it's UGC, it's so believable and penetrates the brain so well you will not forget this. The caption, boyfriends, please take note the holidays are coming. Fantastic. It was also shared to her page and her whole page is sticks like this. So her audience who they tapped into knows her for this and would love this content. Love it. Number two, collecting celebrities like Infinity Stones and putting them into their marketing videos, but not doing traditional marketing videos where they're like in studios, stage, high production. No, they're untraditional. They're super fucking weird actually. And when they come across your page, you're like, wait, that's true, Starkey. It's Louis Vey. But also what are we doing? What is this video about? But they are wearing the way they. And so at the end of the day, they are promoting the product, but not in a way that's like super in your face. And that's cool. Allow me to show you a few examples. Oh, that the people that they're collecting like the Infinity Stones are the people who their audience or the people who they want to draw in are interested in. Just based on the people that they are working with right now, they're clearly trying to draw in a younger audience right now. The thing they're promoting, the Aviator jacket. It's great. It's just like you can't stop watching it. Why did I watch that 15 times? I don't know. Because Drew Starkey's in it and he looks sick. But in reading the comments, so many people rewatch this because they thought that this man was a wax figure. They thought he wasn't moving. Also, super original take on the fact that so many brands are using food with marketing to pair them together. They just fucking held up the food in this in a super weird way. And that's how they took it on. But they're clearly promoting the bag. It's just, it's very unique. Like it's strange and it makes you watch it over and over again. In the comments, people are like, I watch this 45 times. It's working. And having men in particular hold up these bags, it gives unisex. They're targeting men and women. Another thing that they always do is they have them say, Louis, which is something that people struggle with saying. And it's part of their marketing strategy to have it in their marketing videos. They've done some really funny videos in the past trying to explain how to say Louis, and they just lean into it because they know what it's hard to say. This is so funny. Like, what is this outfit? And then they have the guys, the soldiers to say, I'm wearing medieval, medieval, medieval. That's hilarious. The third and final thing that they're doing is they're targeting all generations in a super funny way. They recognize that Louis, they has actually been around forever. They have new creative directors. They have new people that have come on board. They've reinvigorated the brand. And there's a whole new generation of people that are interested in it. But they've also been around for so long that there's multiple generations that are interested. So this video I thought was perfect to show that they are for everyone as long as you're going to afford it. Is that hilarious? They nailed every single person, every single audience. They're telling you without telling you, we know that you're all here. We want you to all be here. This one bag can be for all of you. That is genius marketing. It's subliminal marketing and they didn't even have to say it. That's the best part. If you just watched the video, you pick up on that. That's so well done. I think it's a good idea to do this all funny. I'm 65, I'm bleh. What a bird. What would you sound like? That was a bird. I would be a side. Like, that's hilarious. So more of the story is, Louis, there's really that girl when it comes to marketing, pay attention to what they're doing and how they're bringing characters into their world, how they're using those characters, whether it's UGC celebrity or how they're addressing audiences because they're addressing everyone. Age does not matter. They're talking to everybody. If you like marketing videos like this or deep guys like this, go to my page. I have a bunch. I post videos like this all the time. Or if you're trying to figure out how to market for your own business, go to the link in my bio and we can chat and figure out how to market better for you.",tutorial,UK,False
#foryoupage #blowthisup #fashiontiktok #outfitinspo #amadouuo," How to have a more aesthetically pleasing Instagram fashion page. First off, focus on the username and the bio. The keyword is simple. Make sure that you use the name as simple and your bio is simple. For the username, stay away from periods and underscores and for the bio, try to keep it three lines or under and don't use too many words. Second thing you need to do is focus on your posts. Make sure you have quantity and quality. Find a good balance in between. If it's a regular, fit, pick posts, try to keep it six photos or under. This makes it so that people are appreciating each photo and you're not spamming same poses. Also, if you want to quality tutorial, check out my TikTok page. Next, you need to focus on your highlights. I would recommend having three highlights or under and also keep the name simple and keep the profile picture simple. Have one highlight for your fit pics, one highlight for aesthetics, and another highlight for anything else you want. Last off, you need to focus on your profile picture and your cover pages. Try to have the same aesthetic throughout your whole entire profile. And that's how you have a aesthetic look using Instagram fashion page. If you like the video, make sure you comment, like, subscribe for me, or that, and tap the like post fashion content.",tutorial,UK,False
A big old list of content ideas for fashion creators #fashiontiktok #styletiktok #contentcreatorsoftiktok #creatortips #tiktokcontent #contentideas," If you're a TikTok creator who does fashion videos, I'm gonna give you a list of loads of content ideas and tell you why they work and give you tips on how to best use them. I fit up the day of videos. If you're a fashion creator, you should be doing an outfit of the day videos, obviously. Only if you have a nice outfit on, nobody really cares about your boring outfits. If you have something really cool, do a night fit of the day video, cut it to a trending sign, maybe talk people through it. Even better if you're wearing like a trending item, and you're talking people how you've styled it. But yeah, do your right foot of the day videos, make sure you're categorizing them properly, using the right hashtags, tagging any brands that you're wearing. Do your best to make sure that it's categorized properly. Get dressed with me. Same kind of principle, these videos like, I foot of the day videos get dressed with me videos. They provide inspiration. But if you do get dressed with me video properly, you can also provide education if you're giving any sort of like styling advice or styling tips. And also, they're really good for engagement if you're asking for audience input as well to tell you like, what shoes should I wear? Like, how should I style this? Do you like this item? What I wore this week, so whether you do this in like a video montage or like a carousel post, people love a list. The more things that you can put into your video, the better. So if you do like a full list of like, what I wore this week, cut it down like some nice music, talk through it, those will do well. Getting into more kind of specific content, but like five ways to style an item. So if you're wearing like leopard print jeans show five different ways to style them. They need to be totally different ways to style them to keep people hooked and interested and not like any other kind of videos that are like that needs to be interesting. Things that always work well is searchable content. So doing like styling tips for like X body type. So like styling tips for petite people, styling tips for curvy body, styling tips for pear-shaped bodies. Like, whatever you can do, that might be something that someone with that body type would search for. Those can be really helpful. Another fun, more viral idea is like recreating celebrity looks or like looks from Pinterest. These are always really interesting because you're like promising an end result to somebody and people are more likely to stay tuned to like, see how things turn out. Halls always work well. It's the same kind of principle as a list. Like, people love like to know that more is coming. So if you're doing like a big hall, like showing more and more items, it's like a week dopamine hit every time you pull a new item out of the bag. What's new in store videos? So if you're going shopping like maybe taking videos of things that you find new in like high street stores, these are always really interesting and tend to do quite well in terms of views and like, virality as well. Another good one for like, maybe going viral or getting a lot of views are trend forecasts. Even better if you're able to throw like something like weird or controversial in there, that will probably go more viral. What you wanted to be doing with your fashion content as well is making sure that your personality is shining through. So whether that's coming through in the clothes that you wear, whether they're very representative of your fashion or whether it's your voiceovers or the way you talk through an outfit. But one way to do it is like reading my looks from over the years. So that gives people a glimpse into like your life and who you were before you were a content creator. Similar to like what's new in stores, you could also do like what's currently on my wish list. Another fun one is like styling an item I hate. I've seen some content creators do this very well, but like finding different ways to wear things in your wardrobe that you don't necessarily like or you don't think so to you or that you can regret buying. Organize my wardrobe so like whether that's changing up for the season, maybe like getting rid of stuff showing how you put together a capsule wardrobe, people love a bit of organization. Fashion creators also have loads of opportunity to do like good series so you could do like dressing like X for a week. So like dressing like my best friend for a week, dressing like my boyfriend for a week, dressing like I don't know some kind of celebrity for a week. Again, with list videos, you could do like my five favorite places to shop for an item. So like my five favorite places to shop for jackets for shoes, like whatever it is. You could also do other lists like my favorite jeans or my favorite jackets. You could also do a video on how accessories can completely change on outfit. These are quite like dynamic and engaging to watch. And then you could also do a video on like outfit inspiration for XYZ different occasions. So whether that's like weddings or Christmas parties or like I don't know, funerals, whatever it is. But I'm going to move out of the way and I see you can screenshot these and use them for your next videos. Am I maived? Oh, hold on. You're welcome. You're welcome. You're welcome.

Whether you're showing off your signature look or helping others find theirs, there's so many ways to make your fashion your content staple...Which ideas is your favorite? #contentideas #contentcreator #fyp"," You guys, I'm back for another week of content ideas and this week is all for my fashionistas. Yes, I'm talking to all the girls and the guys that just know how to put together a look. So let's jump right into it. All right, so I'm gonna start you guys off pretty easy. Literally anybody can do this and the set is creating OOTDs or GRWMs. And if you're not familiar with those acronyms, they simply just stand for outfits of the day and get ready with me. I really love the idea of doing these type of videos because one, you already have to get dressed. Why not just prop up a camera and share the process with us. Here are a few different ways in which you can do so. I put them on the screen for you guys, but there's so many different creative ways in which you could produce these type of videos. All right, so we're gonna jump right into the second content idea and this is one that I really, really love as well and this is doing fashion halls. Now the reason why I really enjoy this because if you're really smart about this, you can make a little extra money on the side by doing this as well, by associating affiliate links into these type of videos. If you're not familiar with affiliate links are, that's a different video, but I'll tell you pretty much is you just add a link for people to buy from and you get a commission from it. I want to set up something like a TikTok shop or Amazon Influenza program or the LTK program. Doing these halls are super easy. You're already wanting to buy the stuff anyway. All you're doing is showing and promoting it to the camera. So the very last content idea I have for all my fashionistas out there is to do some kind of educational video. Something to teach us something that we may not know that you're really good at. If you're showing us some wardrobe essentials things you have to have in your wardrobe or maybe some styling tips for going on a vacation or maybe how to assessorize a bag or how to assessorize your outfit properly, something that's gonna teach the people something. One thing about it is we all know something that somebody else wants to know. Don't be afraid to share what it is that you know because again, you'll be very surprised at what people don't know, especially when it comes to fashion.",tutorial,UK,False
content creation ideas for lifestyle and fashion creators !!!! #contentideas #fashioncontent #tiktokgrowth #fulltimecontentcreator #whattopostontiktok," You're running out of ideas about it to post on TikTok. Here's some things I like to watch on TikTok as a girl who watches the love TikTok. Romanticizing little activities vlogs. So for example, like a farmer's market vlog or a morning walk or going to pick strawberries. Like romanticizing the little spring and summer things, I feel like it's just so cute and I love watching. A fashion version of that outfits to wear to, outfits to wear to a farmer's market, outfits to wear to a morning coffee date, outfits to wear on a walk, outfits to wear going to a garden. Just little things like that. I love looking at ideas because half the time, I don't want to wear just front-to-back clothes when I'm doing something cute. So I love hearing all the ideas and seeing them. One shoe five outfits. It is really hard for me to pair things together. I have a lot of shit. I don't know how to put it together. So for example, if you have a popular shoe, like a Birkenstock, one shoe five different outfits and just show different ways you would style it within a cute outfit, cozy outfit, casual outfit, kind of a nicer outfit. Show different ways. Glory tour. Especially if it's in a more affordable one because I'm not spending $200 on a fucking ring. But show me affordable jewelry that doesn't harness. That's really good. That's super cute and trustworthy. Because I always love singing. I want to wear more jewelry. I just never know what to get. So please show me yours. I'm worried about one, but I think this will be really cool. Show a vlog of you going on a night out. Like pretend it's like a YouTube video and you're like no sound over, no voice over. You're just with your friends getting ready to go out, showing the outfit, showing the music that you're playing, just the vibes that are going on. Show you guys in the Uber. Show you guys at the bar, just make it fun. I don't know why. I just like watching like real time vlogs. Like not something that's like really edited. Where to buy for blank. So for example, where to buy dresses for a vacation? Where to buy sequins skirts under $100? Like kind of listing out when it comes to finding pieces. If that makes sense, like top five places to buy summer clothes under $100. Emma Pritchard just recently did something like this to where she made videos. She showed like the first TikTok video. She was showing like whether she should wear this or this to a basketball game. And then the next video kind of lingered people to go on to the next one. She changed her outfit and asked for people's opinions on that one. And then she made another video showing the final look together. I feel like that's kind of like a cool way to really keep people engaged and care and kind of get people's inputs and kind of make videos based off of people's comments and opinions of that makes sense for like an outfit video. For example, if I was like you guys, like which outfit should I wear going to the bars tonight? This one or this one post that video. Next video, me wearing the outfit being like, okay, I think I'm gonna wear this. I don't know, what do you guys think? Here's some jewelry I'm gonna add with it.

#contentcreator #contentideas #fashionhacks #contentcreatortips #fyp"," It can be hard coming up with ideas for content. I'm a fashion and lifestyle content creator and I have a whole list of things that I'm gonna share that I think would be good ideas or things that I've done that I enjoy doing for a fashion content creator. Creating a series is always a good idea and one of the series that I have done is recreating Pinterest outfits. So I go on Pinterest to find an outfit that I like and try to recreate it in a way that fits my style. Off it at the day video, those are classics. If you have cute outfit, share it. There's no harm in that. How to style videos. That is something that is so searchable because if someone buys, let's say for example, a mini skirt, they're gonna look up how to style a mini skirt. I mean, that's what I do before I buy pretty much anything. So having those kind of how to style videos are very searchable and will always continue to grow. A week of outfits, those are always fun because you can get five different outfits in one video or you can post them separately, but a week of office outfits or five outfits I wore this summer, those are always good videos to make. Another kind of video that I really like making is one base, three different ways, one base five ways. It basically means that you start with one base outfit, either that's a white tee and some jeans or black on black, and then you style it three or five different ways because it gives the viewer more than just one outfit and it makes them wanna save it because you're giving them more to the video when you have three different options in one video. Another good idea is just showing, basically what's already in your closet. For example, I did a video of just all my white tops because people can kinda get some new ideas of different styles of white tops or like my jean collection and then people would like see the jeans that they might potentially wanna buy. Styling tips are also great videos, any little hacks that you have or just like general things that you might think is like common knowledge, not everyone knows. Doing videos about how to style certain things or like style tips are amazing videos to do.",tutorial,UK,False

Name a better niche fashion content creator… oh wait you can’t #fypシ #fyp #fashiontiktok #grwm #streetwearfashion #streetwearinspo," I'm the best niche fashion filter on this app. And I know that's a bold clip to make, but if you look at my comments, they seem livery with me. And lately I've been seeing this whole niche to counter it on TikTok, so I figured I'd make the best niche fit on TikTok. Let's get straight to it. First of in God, these wax didn't, cause I feel like wax didn't, is it like comments, I guess, okay, kind of niche, you feel me? But even though if I count as niche anymore, like would you call 6.3K niche, like I think I'm still in the category. But back to I'm the best niche fashion to talk around this app. I know my comments might not persuade you, cause of course, some of who follows in comments are gonna like my account. But I get the coasts of people like Braden, Cam, Thrift, Loom. Just something y'all is actual favorite fashion content creators who take on fly. So I gotta be doing something right. Up next, Thundle-Lund is white button down. Now I know white button downs aren't niche. But this one specifically used to be a baggy, long sleeve that I thrifted, but I then tailored it in turn to a short sleeve. So I feel like that on its own makes it one of one niche. I don't know. That next, Thundle-Lund is tie. Now you might be thinking, mine, it's just a tie. That was that niche. When was the last time you saw someone style a tie like this though? I got this idea from St. Laurent's most recent show where pretty much all their ties were in this kind of way. So this is like a niche fire style, which I'm also putting on game. I'm putting on actual design and game, which puts you in the whole lot of the category of these niche content creators. Come on now. We all know this fit. Wouldn't be right. I thought the Loom first. Then we're gonna throw on this other jacket bath, and then we throw on the accessories. And this is the final fit. Very mean the commas went through 10 baths. I think I'm pretty fly. And this is your chance to punch a ticket and be here with a niche. Anybody's gonna catch you on next one. Peace.",talking_head,UK,True

HOW I PUT TOGETHER MY OUTFITS ✍ breaking it down step by stepcbased around a certain item/vibe makes the process so much easier & more enjoyable!!!! #fashiontiktok #fashiontips #fashionhacks #stylingtips #howtostyleoutfits," If you have a really hard time putting an outfit together or you get really overwhelmed looking at your closet every single day, this video's for you. I'm about to spell the formula to always creating a good outfit with zero to little stress. First things first, stop taking yourself so seriously. You can experiment as much as you want to in your room and no one's going to see it. You know what I mean? Like, let's just like, take a breath and release all of those sounds that are trapped in your mind. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Second of all, it is really hard to think and plan an outfit all in one go all in your head. That's why you're getting overwhelmed. Like, dash is hard. What you want to do, go in your closet and pick out one article of clothing that is inspiring you for whatever reason that day. It can be shirt, it can be pants, it can be a dress, it can be shoes, rabbits, and let that be your starting point. Really into the striped button down for some reason? I'm not going to question it. It's just going to roll with the vibes. lately I've been really loving buttoning on my color shirts just once at the top and then leaving it hanging like this. I don't know. It's giving... I don't know what it's giving, but it's giving something. Now because of the base of the outfit, I know the general vibe. I promise you everything else is just gonna flow so much more seamlessly. I'm just going Christmas shopping. I want to keep it casual, so we're just gonna put on some jeans. My favorite styling detail ever, I literally do it with every single pair of pants I own. I always put a little lacy pair of shorts underneath and have it peeking out. Okay, you see what I mean? Like that little white lacy peeking out just gives so much more intention to the outfit. Okay, we got our base, we got our pants next, you move on to accessories. Desserts are literally the most important part of the outfit. Fight me on that. So to kind of tie in the casual look, I'm gonna put on this gray beanie. I really like to layer my accessories as well. So for example, I really like the look of hats and glasses on the face. Also, if you have your ears pierced, don't forget the earrings. I promise you. Whenever I leave my earrings at home by accident, I'm like, oh, this is gonna be a bad day. Next is shoes. I'm gonna say definitely go a lot of different ways with this. That's what I mean by like, there's no wrong answer. But for me, I know I love the detail of a good chunky boot, so we're rolling with that. I've been really into bigger slaps, you bags lately. I just feel like it gives like, I don't care. Oh, fucking care. Like, these in general, I mean, you're done. I have a fully styled head to toe thought out outfit, accessories and earthing. You didn't cry for like half an hour beforehand because you didn't know to wear. Trust me, I've been there bestie and this formula, bullet proof, I'm telling you.",outfit_showcase,UK,False

#fashiontiktok"," Do you have difficulties creating an outfit? Before we start, I want to touch on what an outfit is and what makes an outfit and outfit and not just a collection of random clothes. To begin, an outfit is a set of matching or harmonious garments and accessories one together. Take note of the word harmonious. In my opinion, the clothes don't have to be matching. But the overall look should be harmonious. By the word harmonious, I mean something easy and pleasant to look at. This does not mean that you cannot wear Clashing Colors or print. I love me some Clashing outfits, especially when it's a print. Bird, even Clashing outfits have something about them that is pleasant to their eyes, which makes them work together. And this is exactly what I'm showing you how to do. Here are some reasons why you are struggling to put together the perfect outfit. Your closet is missing some essential items. A wardrobe that is easy to use is built on a strong foundation of essential items. These are the clothes that form the skeleton of your collection and of your outfit. Let me know your thoughts in the comment section. Bye.",tutorial,UK,False
HOW TO PUT TOGETHER AN OUTFIT EFFORTLESSLY #outfitinspo #styletips #swag," I used to spend hours getting ready just for my outfits look like this. So here's how to effortlessly put together outfits winter edition. One, swap your flash shoes for platforms. Unforged flash shoes are like mustard. It just doesn't go well with everything, especially in the winter. Every year wearing is bigger and baggy. So to balance it out, platforms is where it's at. You want to end out platforming up. And these are great if you go on a hinge shape, because you can actually see if they're 6' or just 5' 9"". Two, figure out what shapes and cuts look good on you. If you like baggy jeans, find a swap pair or 1 1 1 1 1 1 that has the same fit, so you will always have something that looks good on you to throw on. Like for tops, I prefer V-neck lines, so even in the winter, I reach for V-neck sweaters over regular ones. But maybe I just like V-neck because sometimes it gives the illusion that I'm not that flat. Three, wear the right bag with your outfits. When you're wearing a chill top that isn't very heavy or volumptious, wear a small mini bag. But when you're wearing a super big puffy top, opt for a medium sized bag or a crossbody bag, because it matches the proportions more. And you can actually see the bag under all that. Or get a statement jacket. Winter weather is depressing, so why don't you be the bundle of sunshine and rainbows by wearing a jacket with life? I love these two, it's so easy to throw on over anything. It makes you look really put together. The long coat definitely makes me feel like a baddie in an evil villain. I love it. Last were accessories that aren't just jewelry. I love me my jewelry, but berets not only cover bad hair days, but are so cute, they're like Cholula hot sauce, they add the flavor you need. Or you can do a headband, some cute glasses. These just do more for you than a man ever can. And instead of a regular beanie, go for like a cat mohair beanie or something, just opt for fun accessories. Anyways, now you're an effortless baddie, follow for more and follow the gram, bye.",tutorial,UK,True

"How to dress better than 99% of the population ‍↕️ 

#mensfashion #summerfashion #summeroutfits #mensstyle"," This is how you're gonna dress better than 99% of the population. Also, this is coming from somebody that wears a white t-shirt in jeans every day, so take this with a grain of salt. A hundred percent of the time, tailoring always beats chasing a trend. Like, most guys wear clothes that fit technically, but they don't really flatter their body. You're gonna eat your basics, your white t-shirts, your pants, everything tailored to your body, so it just has much for a better fit. Even the slight adjustment will make you look 10 times better. That over-accessorizing. One good watch is always gonna be way better than five cheap necklaces. Taking to a signature color palette is almost essential. You don't wanna be looking like you have the entire rainbow all over your body, unless that's your aesthetic, then maybe you do. But in my opinion, neutrals 10 times better. Choose two to three base colors, no matter how you style it, it's just always gonna look clean. And that could be an array of any color palette. I just think the neutrals look the best. Footwear is indeed the first impression. It just is. People judge you based on your shoes. It's just a fact. I read a study about it. I can't find it. I looked, but I've read it before. Your shoes look like this. One, clean them. If you can't get them clean, ditch them, get something better. They can't be great to rotate something like this shoe. First, a towel, you can wear this with a ton of stuff, and just like an everyday train or kind of vibe. And that's all I have. Follow four months fashion.",tutorial,UK,False

But wouldn't it be great if you had a backup plan? Well, don't panic. Here are some tips to get you through these difficult times. Match the accessories and shoes. Outfits that are too matchy can look kind of weird sometimes. It's just too predictable, you know? So how do you escape this without thinking too hard? Get your everyday accessories like belts, bags, and hats. And find some shoes to match the bag. Now what about fit you decide to wear? There is always some kind of coordination. And it's not too in your face. Save your outfits. Outfit repeating is okay. Actually, I encourage it. You really don't need to constantly be buying new clothes and wearing new fits every day. If one day when you have a little bit more time, you put on an outfit and you really, really like it. Why not before you leave or when you get home, take a picture of it? And save it to an album. This way in times of need, you can always access some good outfits at any time. So you'll never run out of good outfits to wear. Smash follow. For more riveting content.",tutorial,UK,False

Pick one piece to style around. For me it's this shirt I just got from Affliction, I adore it. What kind of silhouette do you want to create? Baggy skinny, small topic pants, whatever it is we need a vision for the outfit. I want to wear some baggy jeans with this. Think about color tones. I tend to wear muted colors and I'm going to style this shirt with these jeans. I'm calling out the green and the shirt with the green and the pants and the vibrancy of the colors is pretty similar here. I'm not going to micromanage your shirt choice, but with any outfit there is a spectrum of functionality. For all the pieces. Are you willing to kill your back or your feet today? Mostly I just don't feel the need to explain some convolutive reason why one type of shoe or boot works best with any particular outfit. Try on a few pairs and pick which ones you like the most. I don't know the layer. Sure, a jacket, whatever. For me the layer is helped disguise my chest which is something that I care about as an on-binary person seeking gender euphoria. But it also just makes your outfit more interesting. I do your accessories stack. The bag and the belt might change depending on the day so too the jewelry. If you have a curated stack of go-to pieces that you cycle through and wear with everything, these things will superimpose your sense of style onto a new outfit when you put them on. The final step the most important. Do the spin. Do a little dance. Also you're gonna especially if you comment about my armpit hair.",tutorial,UK,True

I actually would guess that you have a lot of these clothes in your closet already, you just need a fresh way to style them. As always, here's a little cheat sheet, please feel free to screenshot. But basically, the girly casual style is approachable and realistic everyday outfits that have little feminine touches to them. I've listed some common girlier pieces and casual pieces right here. And the main thing I want you to know is that girly casual style really is as simple as taking those girlier pieces like skirts, dresses, really pretty blouses and pairing them with casual pieces. Jeans, tees, tanks, maybe throwing a little baseball hat, pairing a dress with sneakers. I would also suggest adding simple everyday jewelry to your outfits. Now, I would also consider adding a belt, hat, head scarf, headband, any cute little accessories just to give your outfit a little something, something. Let's move on to the outfit ideas. This outfit is what I think of girly casual, really pretty top and a pair of jeans. You can either pick a headband if you want to lean a little more girly or if you want to lean more casual, you can add a baseball hat. A cute little canvas tote gives very casual vibes. Course, a pair of ballet flats, which I personally love ballet flats very girly. I'm obsessed with outfit number two, really pretty flowy skirt, paired with a simple tank top, throw a cardigan over your shoulders or you could wear it. For accessories, we're doing a perfect blend of girly and casual, a pretty necklace with a scrunchy, some really cute sneakers, and a cute little bag. And my final outfit here for you is actually one that I've worn before because I love this outfit. I just wanna tell you about it. Love a cute little rugby top. I think there's something so kind of sporty and casual about it, but paired with a cute little flowy mini skirt is just chef's kiss, such a cute combination. Course, adding a belt and a really pretty handbag. And I love jelly flats for this kind of casual girly aesthetic because it doesn't feel too too girly, but not too too casual either. It's like the perfect blend of both. If you followed me for a while, you know girly casual is my aesthetic. This is what I like to wear in my everyday life. So this was so fun to talk about. I think the girly casual aesthetic is just perfect for us like everyday normal girlies who just wanna look cute, wanna feel cute, but just like don't wanna be too fussy about it. Every week I post a new style guide breaking down the style of your favorite celebrities, TV characters, luxury fashion brands, and overall aesthetics help you dress like your best self and make you feel so confident.

I would have filmed it before church, but we were running really, really late. So, and to be honest, like I've worn this before, and I was like, ah, I don't want to wear the same thing. I feel like I always kind of wear the same couple shirts or whatever to church, but we were running really late. And this is kind of like one of my go-to just regular for like a t-shirt and jeans look, but the t-shirt, like the way it's cut, I really like it's a little bit different, but still really comfortable. And then these jeans, I told you guys, like just I've been taking all of my some of my bigger pairs of jeans and just cupping them out on. And for some reason it feels like a brand new pair of jeans. So, I think these are like the relaxed 90s jeans from Evercrombie or something. Um, but so just these and my clogs. And yeah, that's what I wore.",talking_head,UK,False

I have a girl's lunch to go to today. So let's get dressed. It's just at my aunt's house and I think we're swimming. So I'm literally just gonna dress like shorts, t-shirts, super casual. Let's figure something out. I'm going to pack my swimsuit in a separate bag. I'm not gonna put it underneath my clothes just because I don't really feel like it. Plus there's a chance of rain. So just in case it starts raining, I don't want to be stuck in my swimsuit the whole day. We're hanging out. Okay, I'm gonna wear this oversized t-shirt. You guys see me wear all the time with like my blue backershorts, but I'm gonna wear them with my green backershorts today. We're gonna switch it up. And these are from airy. They're the offline. Then they're like cross over. They're so cute. So I think this is gonna be like the perfect outfit for today. Okay, this definitely isn't what I was expecting it to look like. But I don't know. All a ton of my shorts are dirty. So I really need to do my laundry. You can't even tell, but in the summertime I have to do my laundry way more than the winter time because I don't have that many pairs of shorts. I have a lot but not that much. I'm yapping anyway. I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking this motorcycle t-shirt with this pink skirt, but now I feel like the shirt is too oversized. But I don't know. Do you think it's cute? I'm so in a size of guys. I don't know if this is cute. I'm just gonna stick with it. I'm gonna do pink vanilla and drainage. It's my perfume today. We are hitting the very ends of this perfume. Okay, I'm either gonna wear these flip flops or throw on my black sandals, but they're in the living room. So final outfit. Hope you love. Bye. Love you. Have the best day ever.",talking_head,UK,True

This is the only one that came in time and I already wore it out and you guys loved it. It's such a cute and flattering little black dress. I am obsessed with the little underscirt. Super affordable, I think it's $80 actually. Most of these are under 100. I'll link all of them in my L.T.K. Also, I am obsessed with this dress and the color is so stunning. I am obsessed with a sheer bottom. It's getting more made. It is so gorgeous. And I love when there's a mix of fabrics and make it so much more prettier in a moment for the back. This one is very similar to the House of C.V. version but it's also $70 I believe. It is such a pretty summer dress and I love dresses with corsets. I feel like it makes it so much more flattering. I think this is a keep. Also, I found the perfect summer heels of course from Tony Bianco. How gorgeous are these? Very simple, very elegant but these are so comfy. I already wore them out. This is how they look on. They're so comfortable. I am in love with this dress. I am obsessed. I love the material. It is so thick and good quality. I love the print so much. It makes it look so classy. This is definitely a keep. This one is giving mermaid. I am obsessed. I love when the bottom is see-through. It makes it so pretty. This is also a very easy dress to throw on. It is so comfortable and stretch. This one is very similar to the first dress but much more fluffy and long gone bottom. Very cute and also very comfortable material. All of these are very stretchy. This one really reminds me of the Kai Kylie brand. It's very cute and classy and you can tie this up top as well. More on the bottom. Very cute. This is the last one. It is such a fun Barbie pink color. Probably not for me. It is way too short and less than or shorter. It's a little risque. I really love the material and the pockets. They're actual pockets. They're all in the material and the frill is very beachy. Let me know which ones I should keep and which ones should go back.

"Explaining my recent outfit transformation - this is why the first outfit looks so horrible on me!!

#outfittransformation #kibbebodytypes #bodytypes #styletransformation #outfitbreakdown #outfitexplained"," Why does this outfit look so terrible on me? But this one looks effortless. The trousers are sort of mid-waist, which is a rough point on me. There isn't an in. It's just quite triangular shaped. And the one thing I'm going to do to make it worse is put on this jumper. High neck in general, they're quite sharp. So they add a lot of sharpness near the face. So if you have curve in your frame, it can be harder to do. Now with this top, it's fine because you've got the curve shown up here because of the clingy fabric. Now before I get loads of comments like no one would ever actually wear that, this is a silhouette that I wore. And this was a silhouette that was really popular on Pinterest. Kind of like a cool boyfriend kind of look. First of all, the contrast in color here. We've just got this big triangle of black here, which is no good. The waist is entirely hidden. Plus you've got that sharpness near your face. Now this jumper is not inherently bad when you haven't got all this going on because you've got an openness there. Whereas like this, it's all closed and there's no curve. It also further emphasizes that mid waist point without any waist being shown off at all. So it's like my waist starts here at my widest point. And it's just like I go straight, straight, straight, down into a triangle. A similar silhouette when Audrey Hepburn, who is a fan boy in Camine, was like really quite boyish, cool. It would look a lot more appropriate on her. Whereas this works so well because first of all, it's very fitted. The curve is what needs accommodating in the top half of my body. As well as balance. I need my lines to be very clean and symmetrical and even and not very fussy. So this collar is not very fussy. It doesn't cover up the curve and it adds around shape. It's very fitted. It's not very overwhelming. It's not oversized. It's also not too boxy. It's just a nice in the middle piece. As for the trousers, these work so much better. First of all, there are slightly different textures. They're a little bit more cropped, which honors my slightly short vertical line. They're high waist, which honors the curve. So you can see it kind of continues an allegorous shape here. The fabric of the trousers is more soft than stiff. Even though these trousers have a little bit more structure to them, they sort of blend with the softness in my body more.",voiceover,UK,False

"Replying to @gaietta Brand italiani sostenibili ☺️ 

#shoppingtips #branditaliani #brandemergenti #marcorambaldi #cormio #modaitaliana #madeinitaly #perte "," Deve fare shopping per avere un guardale o ha più curato, parte 5 e questa volta ho fatto una selezione di brand italiani. E per più curato intendo niente fast fashion ma ben si materiale di buona qualità e in questo caso ho inserito soltanto brand a punto italiani e solo sostenibili che ci tengono molto sia alla qualità del prodotto, quindi al materiale ma anche a dove fa nella produzione. La prima categoria sono un pochino questi brand Quiet Luxury, quindi appunto brand un po' minima, comunque classici che solitamente hanno anche dettagli, colori, materiali, abbastanza basics. Il primo brand Quiet Parlo è VIPAV33, loro fanno sia donna che uomo e hanno dei pezzi molto fighi, in particolare per dire questi pantaloni bellissimi. E di noltre hanno anche una linea di lifestyles che quindi potete trovare anche delle cose magari per la casa molto belle. Il secondo brand di cui vi parlo è casa sola, loro abbracciano molto bene appunto il conciato di Quiet Luxury secondo me. Flavia la rocca è il terzo brand e anche lei è molto minima, però magari già con pochino di più con i tagli e anche i volume. Questo completo è un piacere molto. Un altro brand è Bennu, loro si definiscono genderless, cosa che io personalmente apprezzo moltissimo. L'oro utilizzano te su te dadstock molto spesso, la quantità comunque dei loro te su te è eccellente e mi piace perché se perimentano anche magari un pochino di più con la scelta di appunto al qualche te sotto un bel gioco anche di volume. Poi ho aggiunto sulle citi che è questo brand che è un pochino queste vibes più classiche, un po' pradiane, loro hanno dei bellissimi capispalla. Poi ho fatto una categoria brand emergenti che le definiscono che un pochino più sperimentali e ho giunto Cornio che mi piace un sacco. Hanno queste vibes un pochino anni 1992, che sono molto cool secondo me. Poi Marco Rambaldi che forse avete già sentito parlare perché ad oggi nel panorama di brand emergenti italiani sicuramente o nome che c'è spesso e tutto quello che fa è fielissimo la comunicazione che ha funziona da Dio e mi piace davvero tanto. Poi trovate Denge che è un progetto molto figo, loro utilizzano capi vintage che rielaborano e creano appunto dei pazzi unici. Sicuramente magari non è molto commerciale ma è proprio per quello che lo trovo pazzesco, è un progetto secondo me che farà strada. Bellissimo ogni pezzo è super super figo vi consiglio di prequenare guardarvi ogni singola cosa che fanno perché bravissimi. Poi ho fatto una sterezione stampe, questo è anche un po' deformazione professionale dato che il mio lavoro creare stampe per abilamento e appunto Mass 2 brand che fanno un ampiotrizzo di colori e appunto di stampe. Paeri da Ezza è il primo che ho inserito e allora loro hanno un'influenza di raniana quindi appunto anche molte stampe hanno dei richiami coliran che trovo molto belle stampe tra l'altro e un'evedotante di stampe, ma i visse prima sono proprio uniche e date di gli un occhio perché è un bel progetto e come secondo ho inserito folclore, loro praticamente collaborano con diverse organizzazioni in giro per il mondo che creano appunto stampe e in generale anche tessuti quindi ogni prodotto che trovate sul loro sito viene da un determinato paese, una terminata zona del mondo e quindi ci sono diverse cose con diverse anche stili. Pultima categoria, la maglieria e fa anche rima. Prima brand è MT-OF che è questo maglificio che fa appunto queste maglie pazzesche, un sacco di colore e di stampe già card molto belle e poi inserito okma buone che in questo periodo hanno lanciato i loro maglioni su cui potete far scrivere quello che volete infatti ne hanno fatti diversi costito panettone, altre cose pensate magari per il natale perché è un'idea regalo scena anche molto carina.

#ootd #stylishoutfit #womenswear #womensfashion "," How nice and chilled is this outfit. I've literally got these gorgeous halara hand jeans on, really flattering around the bottom area. It's a mixture of cotton, pellet, polyester and alastin so the style is so comfortable as well. Long sleeve shirt over the top which is absolutely beautiful. I love the color. Love the grip to affect that. It's really comfortable, it's got that kind of baggy style to it. I've literally just popped on a little crop top underneath just keeping it really, really chill.

Come si faceva, è vecchi tempi. Non conosco di persona questo ragazzo e non nulla contra di lui, ma vorrei fare delle dovute precisazioni. Inqué, l'abito, disse un grande sarto, deve essere una cosa comoda. Quando io mi muovuo, l'abito non devo sentirlo. Verissimo, ma come dicevi nei latini, in media stat Virtus, la Virtu, sta nel mezzo, che il principio è fondamentale delle leganze classica. L'abito che indosa questo ragazzo, non è nulla che vedere con gli anni 40 e 50. Maniche, troppo lunghe, spalle e torace esageratamente ampi, punto vita inesistente, calzoni tagliati in modo totalmente diverso. Né una cittazione, ni in realtà è una cittazione degli anni 80-90, che a loro volta hanno copiato gli anni 40 e 50. Al mercato mio padre compro. Come sempre, la moda è cittlica, ed è per questo che spesso dico che parlare di vestiario moderno, non ha alcun senso, è tutta la copia della copia. Un abito classico, come questo degli anni 40 e 50 che indoso io, ha spalle e torace a abbastanza ampi da favorire movimenti, ma non esageratamente ampi. Un punto vita che affianca il corpo senza stringerlo, una manica della giusta lunghezza, ed dei calzoni a vita naturale, con piega in vita, è fondo 3,22 e 24 centimetri. Questo significa che per ricreare queste estetica, l'unico modo sia quello di indossare abiti realmente degli anni 40 e 50, certo, gli abiti di quel periodo sono davvero difficilissimi dai mulare, sia pritessuti che per la mano do opera. Tuttavia, si possono ricercare in altre epoche abiti che si sono inspirati agli anni 40 e 50, ma attenzione bisogna saperlo fare e saperlo fare bene. L'abito del ragazzo del video purtroppo non è un grand esempio di ciò. Piuttosto è meglio prendere un bel abito degli anni 80-90, contenti ancora ottimi, ed una manu infattura, ormai a totalmente scomparsa dal preta porte. Questo significa che hai vietato indossare un abito come quello che indossa questo ragazzo? Assolutamente no, uno per moda può mettere un po' quello che gli pare, ma non si può pretendere che questo venga considerato classico, perché il classico non conosce mode e perdura nel tempo.",unknown,Italy,False

 "," come che improvvisamente sono diventata così buona? inamorata! Che vi conosce ormai sa che sono una rompipale per dirlo nei migliori dei modi? e che voglio vestirmi come dico io bene anche per andare in palestra? In Italia se ti vuoi vestire bene per allenarti non è che ci sia questa grande mega scelta a parte qui 3-4 marchi che vediamo addosso a tutti. Bevi posso assicurare che senza andare ad acquistare oltre ocèano ho trovato un brand che soddisfa le mie aspettative. Ma prima lo indosso e poi ne parlo. Questa cosa bellissima che sto indosando è un set di Ijeia il nuovo brand da degliamento sportivo di Carlo Taglottagagna di cui sicuramente avrete già sentito parlare. Perché nonostante sia proprio appena nato e già superin hype. Io sto indosando per precisione la scort che ha anche il taschino e la princess T con le pensi qui davanti con il logo impresso in sì il con e qui dietro. E oltre tutto i capi che indosso sono realizzati al 84% con nari l'ho riciclato quindi un motivo in più che mi ha fatto dire di sì. Ma dove li ho trovati? Ho avuto il piacere di assistere alla apertura a Milano del pop-up di Ijeia che rimarrà aperto fino al 29 giugno. All'interno potrete vedere anche voi i capi della prima collezione del brand. Simposti in questo spazio total pink che ve lo giuro ha fatto gola anche me che veste solo nero. C'è l'angolo per fari James, apparete con il shoot in di Carlo Telle modelle e molti altri cati oltre a quelli che sto indossando io. Chiaramente perché non riesce a passare da Milano da l'Uliu ci sarà comunque tutto online. Io comunque mi sa che queste cose le indosserò anche fuori dalla palestra. I piccoli brand vanno supportati anche nell'active work e ha un segmento che in Italia ancora poco sviluppato mentre in America e all'estero sta veramente volando.

Showing you the first one. They love the pattern so much. Italy there's no way I'm going to wear heels so I love these kind of flats. The very simple white leather flat is the best. This is the first style. Let's move over to a linen dress. I prefer wearing this dress with a belt that would go for matching flats. In summer I mostly wear flats because my feet smell like praise. Look number two I went for a bigger bag. Next we're styling this cute little top. I love these kind of bags. I got this last year in a local store in Italy. The same flat again and some sunglasses. Look number three. A lot of the back of the top. Next one. This is actually from an Italian brand. What do we think of this dress? This was part one of my summer vacation outfits.

#marelboutique #estate2025 #newcollections #lookchic #lecce #modaitaliana #ootdmagazine #purecotton #fashiontrend"," Buonasera a tutte le mie bellissime donne, ben trovate anche stasera. E oggi vi presento un corner bellissimo, cerco di variare ogni settimana per più vorvi delle novità, delle cose nuove. I miei questi sono proprio mirati per, in cui si ervi, per supervi, per come dire, scazze carvi. Ecco, il termine proprio che direi amicale alle mie amiche e proprio questo. I devo scazzecare così. Ecco, qua, guardate che chic. Quindi tocchi di verde con questa fantasia che mi fa un po' da fila rouge a tutto questo corner dove ho inserito anche questi tocchi di beige oro. Parto subito da me, ultimo abito di casa, no secret, bellissimo. E un abito in popeline di cotone, vi vorrei guardate. Sentite, proprio questo frusccio del cotone, bellissimo. E' un rasatello di cotone freschissimo. La particolarità è in queste bretelle così accintura con le fibie oro. E il bustino che è una fascia dritta. Bellissimo perché dietro l'abito a questo tipo di elastico per cui, diciamo, si, come dire, accompagna bene qualsiasi tipo di busto disponibile in tre misure. 42, 44 e 46. Quella che in do so io è una 42. Vediamo che se si legge bene vi dico anche il prezzo. 180 euro. Così magari vi rendete anche conto un po' del caio, del target nel quale ci andiamo o stasera un po' a muovere. Soltanto in verde militare. Mentre invece abbiamo ricevuto questi capi che noi ogni anno veramente, e proprio cieli, mangiamo come se fosse niente, le tuttone di motella, loro hanno le tasche, stupende da poter indossare così molto, molto morbide e molto scivolate oppure da indossare così con la cinta, la dove vogliate magari rende un po' più styloso e un po' più ricercate. In questo caso, così ci ho abbinato un attimo, un elefantino, uno dei nostri elefantini porta fortuna perché mi piace sempre aggiungere un tocco personalizzato a ogni capo. Nello stesso verde, ragazzi, vi faccio vedere lui un abito meravigioso, abito sempre così in viscosa, stupendo a balze cucite, anche lui se volete potete assolutamente portarlo così molto scivolato, proprio il classico abito estivo, oppure se lo volete rendere, attenzione, state mi ben a sentire. Un po' più elegante e quindi sfoggiarlo anche di un'occasione. Allora, sandalo, oro, uno ricchino del genere, vediamo dove la domenza. Ve lo prendo subito perché ve lo faccio vedere, perché per esempio guardate questo ricchino come ci sarebbe da dio. Ecco, così, guardate, ragazzi, guardate che meraviglie, allora per esempio, no? Facciamo conto che indosso un abito così, ci metto sotto un tacoro, la pochettina oro che in questo momento non ci ho apportato a di mano, ma la ve la prendo, vi prendo anche quella perché anche questa, la dovete vedere, così, vi illustrono attimino come un abito che nasce giornaliero, potrebbe essere assolutamente trasformato con due accessori. Sandalo, oro, e poi non scendiamo ad abbinare. La borsettina a tutta di cristalli è uno ricchino importante. Il gioco è fatto, cioè basta poco, molto, molto semplice, due mosse e abbiamo cambiato scena e carattere a un abito. Questo è stupendo, allora ve lo spiego, gonnellone un po' gitano, un po' forco, un po' boh, c'icca perché, perché ha questi elementi anche un po' romantici, come potete vedere, come questa passamaneria, che va a delignare le tre balze della gonna. Mussola di cotone stampata, tessuto meraviglioso, stampa molto, molto bella. La gonna, porterebbe su questo top camicia stupendo, da poter portare così, un po' anodato, manica appalloncino bellissima, perché una manica tre quarti, anche le riprende qua, vedete la passamaneria un po' che la scienza a sparenza il braccio. Il cotone è veramente impalpabile, una cosa meravigliosa. Potete portarla così, molto bella, ma stupendo è anche la proposta così, che a me piace da Marti, quindi gonnellone, con il gile in lino grezzo. L'orono giunto questo fiore per dare un tocco, diciamo particolare al capo, ma è veramente bellissimo l'idea così. Tra l'altro il gileve è molto bene, ragazze perché avendo questa martingala dietro, lo potete rendere anche un po' più sinuoso, un po' più aderente, quindi molto, molto femminile da portare anche senza nulla sotto, proprio a modi casacchina. Oppure, immaginate, veloca, nottina, bianca, gile aperto, un campero, senza ma veramente dei capi meravigliosi. Molto molto bello, così come eventualmente la camicina, che è una camicina anodata, la possiamo andare assolutamente ad abbinare così. Quello ragazzi è che bello, ecco per esempio da fare, abito la nostra camicina così anodata in questa maniera e invece di usare la solita stola, il solito coprispale, possiamo eventualmente andare ad abbinare una cosa del genere che è molto molto bella. Dunque, veniamo all'ui, come vi dicevo, ecco questo velollustro di nuovo, abito meraviglioso, se la lughezza, quindi come potete vedere, io sono alto a un metro e settanta, e lo dico perché tante volte potete farvi la proporcione sulle vostre misure. Io sono alto a un metro e settanta e l'abito mi va proprio alla caviglia, per cui diciamo che un abito molto molto generoso nella lunghezza, che sempre bene, che sempre meglio, perché ad accorciare non c'è mai problema, il problema invece è ad allungare le cose, per cui noi almeno noi tecnici dell'abiliamento preferiamo sempre lavorare sulle lunghezza, è piuttosto che, come dire, avere la problema di allungare. Questo è un capo che vi ho mostrato in settimana, il bel muda che ci è ritornato molto carino, questo qua di eccopelle, ho fatto una storia perché veramente un capo stupendo. In questo caso ho accessoriato da una di queste scinte che abbiamo ricevuto queste settimana, che sono sempre molto molto scenose, cambiano veramente faccia a qualsiasi autofitt, anche al nui, che è un pantalone assolutamente carino, basico, messo con una scinta così, con il nostro giubinetto, a trencino in eccorrena e in ecco de nello ecco. Avete fatto la differenza? Avete svoltato, diciamo così. Poi, sempre in questa tonalità di verde che amo particolarmente, altro capo, iconico per noi perché proprio questi sono i coordinati di seta, che noi ogni anno proponiamo in tante varianti di colori, quindi pantalone con elastico, palazzo, facilissimo, freschissimo, abbinato e coordinato con la sua blusina che ha un giro manne che largo per cui anche lei è una camicinata poter portare così da sola, assolutamente, diciamo che questa, questi completi quando arriva il caldo per noi sono veramente, come dire, proprio una salvezza perché la mattina tivesti, ci metti sotto una ciappattina, un tacchetto, ho un infredito, come ti senti, come ti viene, e sei più che apposto per affrontare la tua giornata, ma sempre in maniera stilosa, ovviamente, sempre in maniera stilosa. Chiudo e concludo con questa con questa gonna che è un capo lavoro, abbiam fatto la vetrina, una gonna di trash come potete vedere perché ci ha sempre soddisfazione, questo è un brand che veramente nulla lascia al caso, qualsiasi cosa fa è particolare. Bellissima, un peccato che non la potete proprio toccare, tessuto è veramente una cosa stupenda, come se fosse quasi un broccato perché tutti questi fiori sono un po' in rilevo e sono meravigliosi. La proposta loro è con questo top mono spalla, top ad opia balda perché, perché la gonna è evita molto alta, il top è un crop top, quindi comunque va un po' a coprire tutta questa parte qua, top meraviglioso in cotone, tutto bordato con queste gocce di cristalli, ecco vi faccio vedere, perché sono veramente dei capi, proprio dei piccoli gioielli. Ora, detto ciò anche qui che cosa dirvi? Anche qui abbiamo le nostre proposte degli accessori, guardate loro, loro sono veramente delizione, sono proprio tenerissime delle minibustine in camosho oppure in appa da 35 euro, sono veramente stupenda. Che cosa dirvi ragazze? Anche stasera devo fare i miei dovuti e sentiti ringraziamenti, perché siete veramente tantissime, veramente non so ma, e come sia un giorno io mi meravigliassi, non lo so, mi continua a stupire, non mi di tenente, sono una boomer, sarò uno, lo sono, perché voglio dire, sono una boomer con cramata, però che dirvi ovviamente mi stupisco da solo, io so, la mi guardo, mi vedo, le mi fa, lo avevi i miei like, che dico cacchio, ma sono ma solo io, sì, oui oui, se muo. E allora vi abbraccio tutte, vi ringrazio e niente ci vediamo in questi giorni per tutti i rill che andremo a pubblicare, per qualsiasi cosa come sempre vi dico, scrivete mi pure, io farò di tutto per essere sempre sul pezzo.

Il vestito estivo a pois più iconico di sempre  #dresses #dressup #summerlooks ," pronti per un Italian Summer Inspired look, il look più iconico da vera, sei sei figli della dolce vita e stai programmandola a tua estate in italia, per dire la frase più abusata di questo socia, vi giuro, non siete pronti. Quindi nulla è stato scelto a caso dal bodi bianco in pizza alla besta e la bianca, una vaid di italianità. La scelta del rossetto rosso era dobligo, per ricriare proprio queste labbra di vada cinema, questo riuscio al rottil puri si chiama appunto cinematic re. Passiamo all'avito. Questo lo cred conta di quelle state italiane dei tempi passati. Sendoci così potremmo solo al massimo sfiorarla e reinterpretarla. C'è, porta mi ha farla dolce vita. Un piazza dell'avito è comunque un mili e il fatto che abbia quintali di tulle qui sotto. La perfezione, guardate che il classi dreata facendo qui. Passiamo il accessori. Vice da seguire per bene lo styling. L'italiana che beve che fè a caprì in piacetta. Cantasanti in stupi tra i viali alberati in Toscana. Chiamore già fino a tardanotte su una rotonda sull'olmare. A portofino? Perché no? Completato lo styling con queste perlone, con gancho, stupender. Un deciso in realtà con queste appendente è clip ma penso che loro si è una ancora più belle. O poi messo i più grandi degli scranchi che ho in bianco. Avenlo già i capellineri. Frisco sempre potere per accesso l'imbianchi affinché si vedano. Poi messo questo bracciale di soru in madre perla. Sarebbe interessante mettere un giro collo di perlo. Ma credo che diventi davvero troppo roba. Se non avete le perlone grandi e volete cambiare con delle perline più piccole. Ad esempio, loro. Potete ad perdere anche gli ammettere un giro collo di perlo. Passiamo i tacchi perché io individuato loro di sfiorwestor. Dechissime non le troverete sul mercato. A me arrivarono queste che ho costruito per tutti questi anni. Che meraviglia. Secondo me, perfetto. Vi lascio la prima oveviuina. Credite, questa era la prima versione del look. E adesso andiamo a completare. Anche il profumo di oggi ha un dot bombato per rotele il tapo con teccarino. Giomagone il salli c'è ricoglia. Come è borsina di venire stare su quel caso è di estremamente piccolo. Comanico. Borsa colmanico mi sattanto di moda anni cinquanta. E' persino la mia nonna aveva tutte le borse con questo manico rigido. Però questa è un taccio di modernità. Dedimam originals. Il faccio in sacco perché è piscina si abbinata con famiglia del gelio. È luminosi, importanti. Anche l'hai il dot che richiamo un po' la sfericità dei puoi. Vigliorecchini, anche se non è imperla. Chiuderemo uno. Chi? E' il dolce video, rati ciuderemo in quelli di inti muovili. E' proprio modivita. Questo è il stato. Ci fa inaggiare a pieno questo film. D'apote ricordare con la stagia di quanto eravamo belle. Piangivani un tempo. Io lo adoro. E' il stato. È la leggerenza delle state di stessa. Cioè è un gioco una picca da avere le state. Però la mia domanda è tu. Vuoi restare in pressa nella memoria collettiva? Sì. Allora ti fornisco a chi consiglio su come completare. Lo starter pack. Di una vera italiana, figlia, classici di Federico Felino. Accessori che io ho uso tantissimo durante le state ma in generale anche per miei scatti estivi sono questi due in pizza che ho compranco rotta ormina. Si tatta di questo ventaglio nero meraviglioso. Guardate la lavorazione in pizza siciliano, stupenda. E' questo ombrellino. Anche lui tutto lavorato in pizza. L'utilità di questo ombrellino è riparare dal cocente calore siciliano o comunque del sud. E se non ombrello parasole non dovrebbe portare sige in casa. E trovo così conico. Io penso che questo look ci rimandi completamente a un mondo delle leganzas delle live. Alla malinconia di un'epoca. Di cui vorremmo ancora oggi fra parte. E basta. Vatemi assolutamente a sapere se questo look vi piace, se potrebbero entrare nelle vostre corde. Se anche voi vorreste affacciare questo fascino questa leganza dal frittemolo. Di avervidato uno spunto sui outfit da cominciare a creare per queste state. E basta per quello che domanda o dubbio. Iscrivetemi, io vi leggo tutto. E' ascio. Un ultima overview di questo religioso look estivo. Vensit, vete mi sapere assolutamente cosa ne pensate. Io vi baccio. Viso.",outfit_showcase,Italy,False

Ladies, this is the one outfit that you need for the next few months. We're going white on white with a tight tank top and linen pants. First, you can go with some simple flip-flops, sandals, or sneakers like I did. To tie the outfit together, throw on a colored button down at my obsessed with powder blue right now.

summer outfits for when it’s BOILING HOT outside #fashion #styleinspo #outfit #girls #fyp ," What to wear when it's boiling hot outside. It's been 30 degrees for the past three days here in Toronto. So I'm gonna be showing you guys all of the outfits I've been wearing during the heat wave. We're starting off with my favorite outfit to wear for when it's hot out and it's literally just a mini dress. Also, the wearing my active wear mini dress in the summer because there's built-in shorts, a built-in bra and it's wet wicking. Also look really good with sneakers for the girls that don't like showing their toes in the summertime. This one's also one of my favorite mini dresses. And the best part about this combo is that it's a low effort outfit that looks like a high effort one. Next, another one of my doichos, which is a tank top and a skirt and it can literally be any skirt. Like you can do a score of maybe four maxi skirt and they're all easy, breezy and more comfortable than any type of pants. Moving on when it's hot outside, you will never, ever, ever catch me wearing any type of denim. And said, for some reason I wanna wear any type of pants, I will always do a linen pant and pair it with a not-type but flowy top like this one or this one. Lastly, probably the most comfortable but the least stylish outfit that I wear. My mini shorts and a tank top. I also live for shorts that have like a cotton or lineny material. But those are all the outfits that I have for you today. Let me know what you think and if you want any more summer outfit recommendations.",outfit_showcase,Italy,False

I don't know what it is with the color blue. I think it just looks good on everyone, it's kind of like elegant.

"Você vai curtir o Eurosummer? Salva esse post ou manda pra quem você sabe que vai viajar! ☀️

Se você está vindo pra Itália entre ✨junho e setembro✨ saiba que o verão europeu é quente, estiloso e exige praticidade.

Essas são as peças que recomendo levar na sua mala de mão pra curtir com conforto e elegância direto do berço da moda. 

✨ Conjuntos frescos
✨ Camisa de botão 
✨ Vestido midi 
✨ Shorts de alfaiataria
✨ Saia de cetim 
✨ Rasteiras confortáveis
✨ Bolsa leve de palha ou crossbody
✨ Casaco fininho pra noite
✨ Óculos de sol 
✨ Chapéu ou boné 
✨ Biquíni ou maiô
✨ Saída de praia 
✨ Batas e blusinhas leves

#eurosummer2025 #italianstyle #maladeverao #consultoriadeimagem #ladolcevita #viajareestilo #italianvibes "," O que eu levaria se estivesse vindo pro verão europeu, sendo uma mulher que morou 6 anos da Itália, 3 anos na Espanha, sendo o consultor de imagem e já tendo feito várias malas planejadas. Você vem para a Itália entre julho e setembro, prepara-se para muito calor, mas assim, muito calor. Dia de 30 a 40 graus, céu azul e muita caminhada. Começando com conjuntinhos leves, então leve com juntos frescos, coordenados, eles são práticos e elegantes e você consegue usar em vários lucos diferentes ou juntos é ótimo. A misa de linha ou de algodão, invista em tecidos naturais, porque faz muito calor. E esses tecidos são a cara do verão italiano. A camisa de botão traz uma elegância também, então assim, este que tem. Chorte de afetaria e tecidos leves, principalmente as cores mais claras ou mais vibrantes. Invista em peças frescas que não amassem tanto e que tem um toque de estilo. Nos sapatos, sempre há algo confortável e mais aberto. Aposte em rasteiras, papéis, tênis, bem leves e neutros, porque aqui se anda muito. Uma bolsa leve de palha ou um acrossbóri são as bolsas que eu mais indico. Bolsas leves práticas elas fazem toda a diferença no calor e nas fotos. Dependendo da região que você vai, dá um frosinho no final do dia, então leva assim um casaquinho. Mesmo no verão a noite pode bater um ventinho, então um casaquinho mais leve, salva a vida. Um vestido mídia ou uma saída de setinha elas fazem toda a diferença. Para unjantar a hora no oite, um passeio mais elegante, nada mais do outvita do que um vestido leve fluido. Pronto para viver o outvita, se arrumabem aqui, não é futilidade. É quase que faz parte da cultura. Eu tenho certeza que você vai amar e você vai ter recordações e lindas da sua viagem.",unknown,Italy,False

"A sunny Thursday in my life living in Torino, Italy ☺️

#dayinthelife #movingabroad #digitalnomadvisa #turin "," Welcome to a day in my life as a 24 year old living in Italy and remote working in branding. So sorry on my day off with pug pung in the bed. I've been loving the morning light in my apartment. It's been so sunny here. So I've also been really careful about wearing sunscreen every day. And then just getting my little workstation ready. I don't have a desk, so I just work for my dining table. And then I don't leave the house without curling my eyelashes and using the Elf brow gel, which I'm going to have to fly back to the US when I need to repurchase. I moved here about five months ago and I'm still implementing a routine and seeing what I like to do. Especially with this new schedule of working on a different time zone as most of my colleagues are in the West Coast. Like sometimes I stay up pretty late on calls or just working in general, so then I don't really wake up that early and also tell me I need to wake up that early. So I'm still kind of figuring out what works for me. Today I woke up at 8 and it felt manageable. And I was still able to be productive. For breakfast, I had an omelet with three eggs and I've been obsessed with my carbon steel pan that's now seasoned, so everything is non-stick. And then I always make two shots of espresso with my mocha pot. And then I got some work done. And then a friend and I walked to go play tennis together for the first time and it was so much fun. I cannot wait to play more with her. And then we walked back. It was so beautiful and then took a little shower and made some lunch, which was bomb. I've kind of been on a roll with these recipes and I'm really glad that the inspiration is there because I was lacking it for many months. But it was hopeless. Wrong on her mind. I've been listening to the audiobook of Harry Potter while I work and it's been amazing and totally makes time go by so much faster. I can never just work from one position so I always go from the dust to the sofa. My mint plant is growing roots and I'm so excited. And also it's cherries. I didn't realize it was cherries. I made some dinner and just some bok choy rice and some hot stickers. Time to turn on the mood lights and the sun's that was so beautiful. I've been loving the sock curls for my hair. I feel like I wake up my hair is so glossy. Also obviously curled and then I went to bed. What I don't take.",talking_head,Italy,False

We could day trip to these beautiful blue springs in Tuscany. It was pretty easy to get to. It was about an hour bus ride. Once we got there, it was so fun. We all just laid out and turned. There was a waterfall. We got to swim in the water. It was such a hot day. So it was so fun to just come here and relax with all my friends. Took the bus back to Florence, then got changed, and went to a perfume launch party. It was one of the coolest things I've ever been to. Actually, I can't believe I was invited to come here. Like, what is going on? I've always loved making content and posting on social media. It's something that's always been so fun for me. It absolutely blows my mind that people reach out to me and invite me to these events just because I post my silly little videos in Florence.

Melionota come Clinica Privatacolumbus in questo edificio libertito del 1913 progettato dal Summaruga, la columbus era la mia Clinica preferita Milano. Non so con quale fine io stia facendo questo video, un documentario, una presa per le CUP ci tenevo comunque a mostrarvelo perché secondo me è molto bello anche gli interni guerati questi qua sono le sale d'attesa. E anche la passicceria bassiello che hanno passicceria molto buona anche se questa nello specifico è un po' meno buona rispetto alle altre che ci sono Milano, ma comunque molto carina. E si può dire che sia uno dei miei posti preferite Milano perché da grande poco Andrea che quando non so cosa fare voglio spendere un po' il mio tempo, va doglia fare qualche controllo random come ad esempio l'olter l'anno scorso come lo sono fatta attaccare al core per un giorno intero, perché te mi voglio essere rischio in fatto. A quanto pare no? Comunque questo controllo che io ho fatto perché sono caruta dal marcia pede è andata buon fine o sonamente una distorsione dell'alluce bu, quindi alla stragrande e quando sono usci, la gestione della rabbia voto meno 500, torniamo noi perché CUP, perché sulla facciata laterale ci sono due sculture con le chiappe al vento. E da per questo poi che il palato è stato sopravnominato in questo modo, non particolarmente apprezzato, io lo trovo simpatico che però forse non è il termine migliore perché simpatico è un po' come dire carino ragazzo, un po' una merda. E' bello anche farse una passeggiata nel parco intorno alla villa perché ci sono diverse sculture, statu, ci sono dichioschi, tutti di legno, intrecciato, guadate questa è una baita, con anche le sedute ricavate dei tronchi e proprio un bello spazio. Questo pillo, l'architettonica si conclude qua, quindi ho vincito di andare a visitarla da fuò non entrare, è un'entrata cazzo, l'entrò della clinica perché non si può, però così per far due passi se passate in buona roti che poi la via che finisce in Giulio Cesare con City Life a Milano è molto carino da vedere, sommaruga, ame piace, poi estire liberti tre migliori.

"NOT DIRECTLY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE, just want to give y’all sauce & a heads up of what community you’re diving into  hope this video helps you start your journey  #fyp #viral #fashion #fashiontiktok #OOTD #fypツ #fashioninspo #streetwear"," Here is how to be a fashion creator in 2025. I'm gonna teach you how to make some money on boys. It's 2025 and a lot of people are trying to grow their personal brands and their identity. Now, before you become a fashion creator, please understand the community is so toxic. It's a really toxic community, I'm sorry. If you're not wearing tabbies and acne studio jeans, Old Man Jenkins jacket from 1855, you're not him. Ha ha ha. Pretty much cook. However, just wear what you want, because that's all that matter. The rule number one, to making content, you need confidence. Been making content since Vine. Now, I swear if I see uncomments, bro, you're banned. I started making videos since Vine, then I was a YouTuber, then I did Fortnite YouTube, and then I did custom YouTube, and then I'm a tech talker. Ha ha ha. My gosh, brawmwash. Number two, what is the purpose of the video you're even making? Listen, we have seen the people shake their jeans, throw a gang sign and walk off. I used to do it too and did it work out. No, since I started opening my mouth on the platform, yeah, it started working out. It takes us to number three. Have a personality. For my case, people just know me as the one dude that has the crazy laugh and the run-your-banz method. Now, I don't do the run-your-banz method, and I'm, I don't feel like a thing and I do. Gosh, dude, I ship out my orders, dude. I shipped everything out yesterday. Before, bro, you need quality tools to make the content. The DJI microphone. This is not sponsored. How much is it? Oh man. Ha ha ha. Prepare to take out something in your grilled cart, buddy, because this microphone's 160. It really is worth it. And on top of that, with the content you're making, you're gonna make it back. Next up, tripod would ring like Amazon. Next thing you need is a background. Now, my background is just me. This is literally just me as a wall. And then obviously, you need your phone. I have an iPhone 14 Pro. I also switched off the front mirror. Which pretty much means you can read this right now. Lastly, what I used to edit with is CapCut. Number five, you need to be consistent. Gotta at least upload a video every single day. I'm even twice a day. Make sure whatever you put on TikTok, you're also putting on Instagram Reels. Might as well grow both platforms. Lastly, please just have fun. Make content because you actually enjoy it. A lot of people are so driven by money. The money's gonna come as long as you're passionate. Also, be careful with a lot of these influencers that you wanna make friends with. A lot of them are not who you really think they are. This is not direct shade towards nobody. But I'm not gonna lie, the fashion community is pretty toxic. And a lot of these people have egos for wearing clothes. I still to this day will never understand. I want you to have an ego for wearing clothes. Like, bap! I hope this video was helpful and I appreciate you.",tutorial,USA,False

#fashiondesigner #fashiontiktok #artistsoftiktok #metgala #sewing #artist"," Growing up I always believed that being an artist was not a full-time career. I always cared about the wrong things and I always cared way too much about fitting in and I didn't fully believe in myself that I would be able to become a full-time artist. In the past like six months literally all of that has changed. I don't give a fuck about what anyone thinks. What's up I'm Jacelle and I'm 20 years old and I am a full-time artist and fashion designer. During high school is when I started taking art very seriously. I would make things every single day. It was all I could think about and I even got into fashion and I started taking that incredibly serious too and I was learning how to sew and I was signing up for all these classes to perfect my skills and I started making all these dresses and I was selling prom dresses and I can make sewing suits and do all these things because I thought I couldn't pursue art even though that's what I love most. I was like okay the fashion industry has a bunch of jobs and I know I'm good at it so I'm gonna go to fashion school and pray that that leads me somewhere right. So I moved to Paris and I went to fashion school there and I really enjoyed my time in Paris that was fun but the school itself I did not enjoy and I learned very quickly actually that the fashion industry just is not for me. So I dropped out of fashion school and I moved back to California and I just started taking community college classes, all art classes. I started posting on social media and I just became super consistent with that and now everything's changed and I'm doing this full time and I'm paying for my own art studio and it's insane. A director from when I was a kid doing theater reached out to me and was like hey do you want to come cost and design Shrek and I was like hell yeah why not and then ever since there I've just been designing shows I did Fiddler on the roof and then the Adams family and I'm deciding what shows I want to do next.

a lot of you guys ask me how I got started so here’s my story. Let me know what else you want to know ✨ #grwm #storytime #fashion," how I became successful in the fashion and stream and as a business woman. I actually went to fashion school, but to note, you do not have to go to fashion school in order to be in fashion. Actually, I was a worst student. I never showed up for class. But I interned a lot and I assisted a lot of people so I can learn the skill. Basically, I was in halfway in Devilware's Prada, but I was getting paid at all. And while I was interning, I also started my blog. I don't want to wait for an opportunity. I just wanted to create something for myself. And keep in mind that no one was really blogging back then. This was 15 years ago. It was just weird to have a blog. It was really just a passion of mine and a way for me to just release my creative outlet because I just loved fashion so, so much. And then I started on my YouTube channel as well. Back then, there was no one doing fashion tutorials. It was only kind of beauty videos that you saw online. So I was actually one of the first fashion gurus on YouTube. I was still in college back then. And honestly, I didn't just for fun. I didn't expect to make any money from it. But it was actually during that time when people were starting to take notice of, quote unquote, influencers. We were not called influencers back then. I think we're called like YouTubers and bloggers. So while I was in college, I would just be consistently posting videos. So after my classes, I would film videos and all of a sudden, one day, a brand reached out to me and they wanted to pay me to create a video. And for me, I was so confused. I was like, why did they want to pay me? Maybe a year into creating content. I made my very first paycheck. It was small, but I was so excited. So I gave myself a deadline. I'm gonna give myself a year to save as much money as I can to not have to work and to create context. I just love creating content. So after a year, I did that. I was able to make enough money where I didn't have to actually go get a job. And so I told my parents, I pressed it, I was crazy. But the most important thing that I did that made the biggest difference was when I got paid, I actually used that money and invested it back into my business. I actually hired people to help me to create more content. And I honestly think that was one of the reasons why I became very successful is instead of like going out there and buying like the newest itbath, I actually invested it into people. I mean, I'm telling you guys that we were a content machine back then. And my secret weapon was really my team. So the biggest lesson here is not just to make money, but when you make money, how are you gonna invest that back into your business so it could catapult you? Back then, no one cared about influencers. They thought we were joke. But 13 years later, here I am. It's a matter of being creative. The guests are the box would also be persistent and just sticking with it and not giving up. So let me know what you guys want to hear more about. All right, bye guys.",talking_head,USA,False
The fashion space is a tricky tricky B word! #TikTokShop #AffiliateMarketing #TikTokAffiliate #SocialMediaMarketing #AffiliateTips #TikTokTips #fashioncreator," I've made almost $400,000, maybe more than $400,000 as a TikTok affiliate. Most of my GMV, most of my sales and most of my income, come from fashion, like clothing. And on our coaching call last night, by the way, we're getting unready together. On our coaching call last night, her profits Academy, and we had a group coaching call, and a lot of people wanted to talk about fashion and how to successfully do it because a lot of people were struggling with fashion and posting about clothes. And I just so happen to be, I don't wanna say I'm an expert, but again, I've had a lot of success with clothes. And I'm gonna say this, I'm gonna hold your hand and say it. If the clothes are basic and the clothes are meh, something you can get on the shelves at Walmart, if it's super, super basic, without having anything about it that's special, it just isn't gonna do well. And if the product itself is boring, or not that attractive, or like I said, meh, it isn't gonna do well, it's just not gonna sell. Remember Bestie, it's social media. If it isn't very exciting, there's nothing unique about it. It's just the striped sweater with nothing unique about it, not extra flattering, not extra unique. It's not gonna do well. Social media, like when you start off a video, you need a hook. When you start off a video, you need something to get someone's attention in the fashion space, it comes down to visuals. It comes down to whether or not people give a damn about the sweater. And if it's a basic ass sweater, then anybody can get from anywhere, it just isn't gonna do well. Okay, so how do we remedy this problem? Because like, are we all fashion designers, and can we all just pick the best top fashion that's gonna sell really well? No, even I, somebody who has always gotten compliments about my clothes, it has always done well in the sense of fashion, has a really good keen eye for it. I still have to check these check boxes. So again, as somebody who's made hundreds of thousands of dollars from this app, specifically in fashion, I'm gonna give you my check boxes, what I check off in terms of how I do this, and how I rock the fashion space. Okay, it's not about hooks, it's not about how gorgeous you look, has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with the aesthetic of your house. It's all about the product selection. I guess I'm giving you advice with bad lighting, but I ran out of time today to give you advice. Check box number one. Does the product have a lot of sales already? You need to check the sales. How many sales are we looking for? Nothing under a thousand, especially if you're a new creator, because if it's under a thousand chances are, unless it's brand new, chances are it's another nothing great about it, nothing unique, nothing special. Okay, if it's high sales, and it's fairly new, right, within the last six months, then it's a go, because a lot of people found it interesting, a lot of people liked it, and a lot of people wanted it. So that's what you're gonna do. You're gonna look for the things that have high sales. I sometimes even look for things in the 10,000s, 20,000 range, 15,000, 5,000, anything below that we're risking our, you know, we're kind of taking a risk in a chance. Again, this is if you're new. If you are already big in TikTok, you've got a big following, you've got a big TikTok shop presence, and you've done really well, you may be able to make a new product that's never gone viral, you could make it go viral. But the rest of us have to operate on strategy, because we have a limited amount of time, and a limited amount of resources, so we have to work with what we have, and we don't have all the money in the world by all these clothes. So our limited samples and our limited amount of clothes, we have to choose wisely. So don't waste your time. Just do the ones that are viral. There are plenty, and how do you know if it's newer? On the newer side, it's not like two plus years old, or over seven months old. Go and look at the videos that were already created about it. If it's viral, there will be videos at the bottom, learn from creators. Anybody viral yet? Okay, great. Look at their video, what's the date on it? There is a threshold, and a fine line, because it can be two viral. Like over 30,000, and tons and tons of viral videos, and it's been on the TikTok shop for months and months and months, then it's likely an oversaturated situation. And yes, it is possible to be oversaturated on TikTok shop. I've talked to TikTok shop, or TikTok star creator program directly, and ask that question. And the answer is yes, you can, in fact, be oversaturated. So there's a little bit of an art to this. Okay, also, next, is it cute to you? You have to like it and be excited about it, because if you think you look like a clown in it, or if you think you could not get a fit it right, and it looks stupid on you, no sense. But you have to like it, right? If you look in the mirror and you go, I look stupid, and then everyone else that loves you says so too. They're like, girl, you look, no, that's not your thing. Then don't do it, because if you come out looking like Bozo, the clown in your mind, you're gonna act like you look like Bozo, the clown when you're talking about the product. There's really so much more I could go into, but those are the basics. That's the necessities. If you need help with TikTok shop, you need help with growing learning TikTok shop.

#foryoupage #blowthisup #fashiontiktok #outfitinspo #amadouuo," How to grow your Instagram fashion account. First off, focus on your fits. Make sure that your fits are at the best quality possible and that you're putting an effort into each fit. It may be slow at first, but after a while, you'll start to get recognized. And if you all want a quality tutorial, check out my TikTok page. Second thing you need to do is be consistent. Make sure you're posting fits regularly and that you're posting on your story daily. I would recommend posting a fit every week or every two weeks. Make sure to post on TikTok too, because all your TikTok followers are gonna come and support you on Instagram. The third thing you need to do is show support to other people. Make sure you're consistently liking, commenting, and reposting all your mutuals content no matter what type of content they do. Being genuine and showing support to other people is gonna take you a long way. Also, don't be gay keeping and try to help other people if they ask for it. The last thing you need to do is just be yourself. People will like you way more if you show a genuine character rather than trying to act like someone else. And that's how you grow your Instagram fashion account. If you like the video, make sure you comment, like, subscribe for me, or that, and tap the good love of special content daily.",tutorial,USA,False
My 5-9 as a Fashion Influencer! This is work okayyy lol but we’ve got plans & goals so it must get done! #fashioninfluencer #fashiontok #howtobeaninfluencer #contentcreator #creatorsearchinsights," You said you wanted to be a fashion influencer, but you don't know where to start. Hey, girls, be my fives. And I would be because we are not full time yet, but the way that we're going, we will be there soon. So I got off work. I did my glam and I'm about to shoot content for YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest and Amazon and LCK. I'm basically filming one video, but with that video, I'm filming other videos as well. So I'll kind of show you all what I mean by that. But I just want to go ahead and start to solve this. It'll kind of be like a nightcap. So let's get started. Now this is what I meant. I'm shooting for multiple platforms. This content you're seeing right here is going to be my short form content. So this is for like TikTok, LCK, Pinterest and Amazon. Okay. Also, I'm checking in. I just filmed kind of like B-roll basically me just doing this for every single outfit. And now I'm going to film the sit down part where I basically showed them the products in a little more detail. And then I have to edit the video, put everything together, but we'll talk about that after I film the sit down part. I wish I would have showed you all this sooner or not before I even plan out a video. I plan on my outfits and I plan them out by going to Canva and making flat lays like this. Later on, I actually can use these supposed on my LCK, my Pinterest and my Amazon. So this is something to consider if you're a fashion influence. And now this next part is what I consider office work. I edit my video, I edit my thumbnail and y'all work smarter and harder. I use chat GPT to give me my title, my tags and all of that good stuff. I then do some work on my Amazon store front, my LCK, all of that stuff. The video is now live. Go give it a wide follow if you enjoyed this and go subscribe to my YouTube. If this is the kind of content you enjoy.",outfit_showcase,USA,False
Step by step on how to increase your income as a fashion content creator #pinterest #ltk," Okay, so I've heard a lot of people also tell me that they don't understand like the money making portion of LTK being an LTK creator. So I think having a system is what works in order to make money with LTK. So when I talk about your social media content, when I talk about Pinterest, when I talk about LTK, they are all interconnected. And this is how your process should go and follow. If you want to ensure that you are making a good amount of money, meaning at least this week now, I think I said like yesterday, I think I'd run $250 or so for the week. Right. And this is me only, I've only posted like twice this week. Okay. So here's the process that I follow that I think works. Okay, because I'm not in a business of why anybody, I post great shots. Okay. So you create your content downloaded from Kafka. Great. You uploaded onto LTK and LTK automatically generates just the link for you. Many of you upload this content to LTK. You link your clothes, also link alternatives. Okay. Even if they don't have the direct links, try as much as possible to link alternatives. When you've done that, you're in your link. Sometimes I use many chat to depend on what kind of thing that I am posting. I use many chat if the brand is not on LTK. But I always think the great way to go is it's LTK because they've now modified where you can actually respond to people because I hit the idea of you just sending a link and now responding back in the comments, which is what many chat have over LTK, but they fix that now. So let me backtrack because I like to talk a lot and go off tangent. I'll upload your content onto LTK, tag all the products, get your link from LTK, upload your content to these all your social media platforms. If it's YouTube, upload it on there. IG, TikTok, whatever it is, threads upload your content on every platform. Right. Now with IG, we all know that if you upload your content and put it in caption, people comment, shop, they automatically get that link. Now the connection between IG and Pinterest that I just talked about is the fact that the moment you upload your content onto IG, it automatically goes on to Pinterest. Right. Now you can either leave it as is, meaning when people go on your Pinterest, they must click that link, it automatically drives them to your Instagram. That's another way to drive traffic. You're doing it like twice, meaning you're uploading a real right where people get to see your content and even if it doesn't reach, you're also uploading it on Pinterest where people get to find your content. People get to find you and see you and there's certain kind of words that you can put in your videos and things like that and we can get into that later. I'm literally going to sit down a longer form of this on YouTube later, but right now I'm just telling you the quick beats and pieces of what you need to know to make sure you're setting up a system that works for you. So we talked about that LCK, grab your link, post it on all your platform, make sure it's linked in your body. I don't understand why else is fashion creators on making people jump through who's to find links. It's 2025. Let's do better than that. Okay. So anyways, once you do that on Pinterest, you can either leave it alone, meaning as you upload on Instagram, it's automatically uploaded on your Pinterest or you can go back on to Pinterest. So as this automatically uploaded for you and changed the link, meaning when people click the link on your Pinterest, they can either choose for them to click the link, they go to Instagram or you can make it super easy for them. Go back on to LCK, not just that link that leads to your LCK, but the link that directly links to the actual website. So meaning if I uploaded this jacket, I did them click in this link and it takes them to my LCK store, which is great because it grows your followership on LCK brand, see you collaborations great, but also you want the final sale, right? You want them to also, you know, purchase the outfit from you or whatever. So what you end up doing is that you take the reward style link that directly links the outfit to the website. You link it to that Pinterest post and let it live, marinate and sit on that website on Pinterest. And I buy the grace of God. And mind you, you guys, I'm a Jesus baby. You guys see Jesus in fashion. I do not do anything. Like even if it's like posted link in fashion, would doubt back in the book God, God is always going to be my source. Okay. It's not by my power, not by my might. I back out the number prayer. Okay. Even if I'm applying to something, if I'm posting a content, whatever it is, I pray really God, you are the master strategist. I can transmit this possible, but you're the one who's going to carry this far and wide. So I have my prayer today. I live it alone. I sleep. I wake up in the morning. I check my accounts. I see how much do we have today. Okay. Great. Last week, we were like one something this week, we're at two something that's already 350. You can make about a thousand dollars a month by doing this. I can let you know that for a fact, you can. So yeah, hope this was understandable. If you want more explanation, let me know. And the next video, I'm going to show you guys my outfit at the end.

Up close & personal today! My biggest tips to grow your fashion brand in 2025  #fashionmarketing #melbournefashion #digitalmarketingtips #digitalagency #ecommerce #ecommercebusiness," If your goal in 2025 is to start your own fashion brand then listen up because I have my top tips that I would be doing if I were starting a fashion brand in 2025. The first is to post the whole journey on TikTok. I think that this is so important and honestly so simple to do but what it's going to do is actually allow people to buy into your journey, buy into the brand even before you have launched. It's so so important these days to be utilizing TikTok. I think more and more people are jumping on there every single month and I know a lot of brands also tell me you know they're a bit too high-end for TikTok and things like that. There are all types of customers on TikTok and I honestly am starting to think that almost every single type of customer or consumer is on TikTok. So my first thing I will be doing is documenting the process on TikTok and showing people exactly why you're building your brand and a bit of a story behind it as well. Next thing is to take the time to get to know your audience or your customer more specifically. Now this sounds really obvious but as a fashion marketing consultant you'd be surprised how many times I hear that people don't actually know their customer at all. It's really important to know your customer down to a tee. If you've seen any of our videos then you know that we hammer on about this all the time so I won't talk about it anymore but just really get to know your customer guys. The next one is to post on organic social media consistently. This also is another one that sounds a little bit obvious but what I would do is I'd choose one platform the main one that your customer is on. So now that you've taken the time to get to know your audience figure out the main platform that they're on and be consistent on posting on that every single day. Now a lot of people say you know do I have to post every single day I'd say do it to maintain consistency. This is something else I've talked about on here as well but consistency is everything so find which platform your customer is on post on there all the time. The next one is selling live on TikTok or Instagram. This can be a little bit daunting and I know that a lot of founders and a lot of people in general don't even like showing up on stories or TikTok let alone selling live but this is such a good way for you to get to know your customer even more and it's such a good way for you to get feedback and talk to them as well as sell your product obviously and by selling live I pretty much just mean jump on Instagram or TikTok live show people different things show them even you just wrapping some orders and things like that but just start talking to them and open up the conversation take on any feedback and they'll sort of get to know you they'll trust you sooner but sooner that they trust you the sooner they get a purchase from you. Now I realize you can pretty much see all the rest but next we've got get social proof this is another important thing in building that trust and social proof also helps you get that authority as well so when people come onto your pages or on your website and they can see that other people that they know or that they don't know wearing your product then they're way more likely to convert so social proof is probably one of my biggest pillars and one of the most important things especially in fashion because it's all around aesthetics it's all around who's wearing what and very trend driven so getting social proof is really important. The next one is optimizing your website now there are so many ways that you can optimize your website and we're just going to give you like a top three things that I would do. The first one is pretty simple make sure your product imagery is really high quality and really really fits your niche make sure that they're going to be really drawn to what your product imagery looks like make sure you've got sizing details right down to whether the product is actually perfect fit if it's slightly oversized those sorts of things people seeing that will really allow them to actually make a purchase decision faster the third thing is probably just to make sure all of your product descriptions are really good for SEO purposes but also so that people can really buy into that product make them a little bit different don't be super boring with your product descriptions just make sure they're optimized and they've got all the information that someone needs to make in order. The next one is make your customer experience incredible so when you are starting a business you have all the time in the world to make sure that every order is packed so precisely it's packed with love they've got a handwritten note they receive it in really quick timing like you've got ample time to be able to make every single customer's experience amazing so I would be focusing on that a lot but the customer experience isn't just about opening the order and things like that it's also from that customer service you provide if they ask a question it's interacting with them it's the email flow that they get afterwards which also goes into my next point. I would be building out all of your email flows and your website pop up. This one at the start I hear a lot of start-ups sort of say to me I don't feel like I need to invest any time into email marketing right now because my list is so small don't think like that you need to start that right now because that's what's going to help you get return customers in the long run but it's also what's going to take time to build and if you don't start now and you start later you're just delaying that process of being able to make money from email marketing when I tell you that email marketing is like one of the biggest revenue drivers for a lot of our clients please believe me because when you put the timing to building your email list nurturing them having your flows and everything set up it's pretty much like almost like passive income so please please build out your email flows and build out your pop up so that people can actually sign up to your emails. I would also be using a lot of smaller content creators and influencers. Now a lot of people say that like influencer marketing is dead and all these sorts of things I definitely think in the last few years things have absolutely changed but what influences are great for again is that social proof so you really want people to be seen in your product and I'd be engaging with a lot of them either just exchanging for gifting I don't know how many actually still do that these days but if they do then absolutely utilize that because they're trying to grow oftentimes and so are you so just utilize a lot of different creators to weigh your pieces take videos take photos post on their socials and then post them on yours it's pretty much what I said by getting social proof. The next one is heroing your customers talk to them talk about them on social media and to build a community it's really engaged in your story and what your brand is about this is one of my biggest tips for 2025 I feel like community is coming back and community is everything so if you can talk to your customers in the DMs or if you can talk to them in comments or on TikTok and then talk about them to the rest of your community then what you're doing is you're again building social proof but you're also creating a bit of a club around your brand so that's something that I would be really really focused on in 2025 but I hope you have enjoyed this list and I hope that for anybody fashion founders out there that this really helps you out.",tutorial,USA,False

"how @Wisdom Kaye became one of the best fashioncreators of our generation (pls someone call the metgala bc not inviting him IS CRAZZYYYY) 

#personalbrand #contentcreators #fashioncreator #socialmediagrowth #influencer"," Wisdom came when for making fashion TikToks in his room to being called the best dress guy on TikTok, according to Vogue, we need to dissect this personal brand and what makes him one of the best fashion creators of our generation. But first things first, give me one good reason why he wasn't invited to this year's Met Gala. Ah, yeah, there's no good reason. Okay, onto the content. You don't need to be a social media strategist to know that he creates visual value. He treats content like art and not just silly little videos. Every video is cinematic, stylized, intentional. He creates content worth watching beyond the trends. And he really makes his own style, not just the way that he styles his outfits, but his actual personal style when it comes to the way he wants his content to be filmed. I did it to produce, he makes that the forefront of all of his content. Good content takes effort and he is putting everything he has in every single video. Second thing he didn't wait. At the beginning of his career, there was a big gap. There wasn't a lot of male fashion content creators and he even said on his spam account that if he was to start creating content now, it would be way harder for him to grow. So basically waiting is the enemy. Like so many creators wait to post, they post the drafts, they don't want to post too many business owners, wait to take action on that idea. Like could you imagine what his career would be like if he waited just even waiting a few months could have completely changed the trajectory of his career? The other thing that he does so well, that a lot of season creators actually have a hard time doing is balancing aspiration and related ability on the scale. You fall under either being more aspiration forward or more relatability forward. Now if you look at his content, he is more aspiration forward. He leans on the side of aspiration. His content, the production, the brands that he's working with, they are more aspirational in nature, but he does such a good job with still being likable and relatable despite the aspirational like quality of his content. And we especially can see this on his second account, which brings me to my next point and my last point, which is I think more creators for their own sanity need to have a spam account. Like we know this on Instagram, it's been says a lot of YouTubers will have like a vlog or a lifestyle account, but even for TikTok, I think especially if you're a creative person with a lot of ideas, you could literally just have so many ideas that brings you into this like paralysis of not knowing what to post because you have so many ideas. So if you have one account that is very focused has a very specific strategy, very specific goal, very specific brand, have your second account that you can just play and have fun and just do anything that you want just to get that creative energy out there without it being so chaotic and so confusing all on one page. And thinking about this as a brand and not just a personal hobby, this is so smart because it keeps things organized. His main page acts like a portfolio of his work without the chaos of everything else, but he still shows his personality a little bit of his life, his thoughts, his rents, still is able to connect with his community on the other account. When I'm watching his content, it's kind of like watching a really good movie and then binge watching all the interviews and the bloopers after. I know I'm just scratching the surface on his career and his success and all of his content just for the sake of like timing for this video. So please let's continue the conversation in the comments. What do you think about him? What are some things that maybe I missed in the video? Let's have about it, let's talk about it. Met Gala really dropped the ball with not inviting him. It's just a shame. That is all. Break a leg.",talking_head,USA,False
I made my first rookie mistake… #fashion #mistake," I just made my first rookie mistake as a fashion creator. I called a pair of cargo shorts some jords, bro. My fault, bro. I know they're not jords. Honestly, don't even know why I said jords, bro. Because I need a pair of actual jords. Y'all flame me so much. I even had to change the fit. But I know you see it, though. Nice little clean, white and black fit. We just got the standard white tee. Paired that up with the pier wisdom pants. Hey, what y'all know about it? I'm about to get the lugo tatted. So that's gonna make me lock in on the journey. But one thing, though, I'm gonna need y'all to follow me on that journey. One way you could support is by dropping a follow on my Instagram. That's at pier wisdom clothing. And for the kicks, we got these new balance, five fifties. Y'all know I had to throw on the white socks crossbody. And we were in the chains for the accessories. Got the earrings in. And we got the Steve Madden watch. It's actually a nice day outside. It's just raining. So I don't even have to wear a hoodie today. And with that being said, it's the man, dev. You can catch me on TikTok at the man, dev or you can slide to my Instagram at dev.pwc. And if you're really messing with the boy, hit up my YouTube at the man, dev one.

Common mistakes for fashion designer - colours #fyp #fashiondesigner #clothingbrandtips #fashiontiktok #fypage #fashiontok #yapping #fashiondesignertips," Common mistakes that I've seen fashion designers do is that when they're designing, when they're sending tech packs to manufacturers, they are designing on illustrator or in design. They don't convert RGB to CMYK. So RGB is for digital colours and CMYK is for printed colours. So work that is going to be printed. So like your posters, your tech packs are going to get printed. When you send your tech pack to manufacturer, the colours on their screen is a lot more different. And most of the time they're using old computers and when they get your tech pack, they usually print it out. They don't walk around the factory with a computer. So they print it out. So I see a lot of mistakes that people do is that and this could save you like hundreds or if not thousands of depending on your sample process. So I see a lot of people when they convert the colours, the hex codes from the RGB to the parent tones. But what you're meant to do you're supposed to convert the CMYK to the parent tones. So when you use CMYK, it's a lot more better because like some of these manufacturers, when you send out your tech pack, they don't really have the parent tones. They don't have those specific pantones. That's why it's depending on the manufacturer that you're working with. So they try to, when they print out your tech pack, they try to match those colours, the CMYK to the best colour that they do have. So that's why you see like when you get your samples, you're like, why is it totally different? Like even this poster I have behind me, like I designed this poster right here. So the first time when I did it, I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I didn't convert the colours to CMYK. So the red there was a lot more, it was kind of a lot more darker. So when I actually changed, when I did the second print and I changed it to CMYK, I got more when I could recall. So that's why it's really important and that's what it also plays when it comes to clothes. So because they don't really have those, sometimes they might not really have those pantones. So those are the common mistakes that I've seen people make. Because if that simple change can really save you hundreds of dollars or if not thousands. But if you guys want an in-depth tutorial on how to do that, make sure you guys follow me and let me know in the comments and I'll make a video real quick about it.",tutorial,USA,False
"biggest fashion mistakes Camilo and Maya wish they knew from the start 

#fashiontiktok #fashion #fashiontips #stylingtips"," Fash your mistakes, we wish we knew sooner because we've all been there done that. So you have number one stop doing too much. You don't need a statement on every part of your body. You can wear a simple outfit but choose accessorizing as the main feature of your outfit because people will have one thing to focus on instead of being an ISIL. Number two just because your outfits are baggy doesn't mean they look good. You still got to focus on your proportions because you're not trying to look like slim shading the early 2000s. No hate to slim shading though I love you but know your measurements and what suits your body type. Mistake three running with what's only trending because I used to copy and paste whatever was on my few page ending up with hundreds of different styles and aesthetics but none of them being my own. So don't hop on to every single trend and take time for your own personal style. Mistake four washing your jeans. I used to think that after wearing my jeans one time out to put it straight into the wash so you don't need to wash them every time and you gotta learn how to do it.

I MESSED UP!!! So much this year so i thought id be open with you all about it #fashiondesigner #fashionbrandowner #businessowner #businessmistakes #businessfails," I fucked up so much this year, so I thought I would talk about it and try to help others not make the same mistakes as I did with my clothing brand. I'm just going to sit here and be so open and honest, but I thought I would be in a much better position than I am this year. And don't get me wrong, like I look back last year and the brand has grown so much and it makes me really hopeful for next year. I've made so many mistakes that have financially screwed me throughout this whole year. I haven't made making one financial mistake. Really impact things and I've made about 20. I have made way too many mistakes. I bought way too much stock this autumn winter. Like there is absolutely no way I should have bought the stock that I did. Just thought that my brand was on a bit of a roll. My customers are super invested, they're going to come back. I'm really going to build my retention strategy and it just hasn't worked out. It means that I've got so much money to hide up in stock and the stock is set in. I haven't got any stagnant stock that's not moving at all. You shouldn't invest so much of your money in stock all at once. It should be a gradual thing. Even if it is setting, if it's not setting fast enough, you're not getting your return fast enough of cash to then move on to summer. That's where I'm at the minute that I've brought out way too many styles. Unproduct meant that I could literally do this business and run with it because it generated me so much money. I should have learned that a single product can change your brand. It doesn't need to be a whole collection. It can just be like one single hero piece and you don't need to bring out loads. I'm making this amount a month from one product. Surely if I have like 10 products, then I'm going to make like eight to 10 times the amount. It just doesn't work like that because the way that my consumer shops, I think, is a lot slower than the normal brand's customer. I'm going to buy everything in the collection because they don't have the money to, obviously you're not going to just splash like six, seven hundred pounds on a collection. I've just brought out one hero piece and allowed for restock, etc. And now I'm going to quickly talk about one other thing that's really messed with me and it kind of links to that. Mid-luxury brands, luxury brands online and people just come for the fabric composition, the quality, the how ethical it is, how much they're paying their workers. And I really wanted to make sure that that's not like an attack on my brand. It has been a lot of controversy this year on compositions, etc. And that's why I've been really focusing on finding like new factories that work with amazing fabrics. They are so high quality and they literally are so ethical because of that. I had to complain that the price is now too high. I can't win. When I did my Black Friday sale, it was mega. I could make so much more money if I was a hundred pounds or less, have a lower margin and just like run with it like that. It just makes me think like, but that goes against everything that everyone moans about. And I was really trying to make a difference by like literally like, I'm not talking about someone like older pieces, but like some of this new stuff is like it's wool, it's a hundred percent wool. And you're getting a wool dress for two hundred pounds. If you go on to revolve, a wool dress on revolve will be like three to five hundred pounds, two hundred pounds to a lot of money. But then you can't complain, like you can't complain that things are being made from polyester. The amount that it costs to make that is ridiculous. If I ever want to be on revolve, just to be transparent, I have to sell my stuff two times the amount as wholesale's price. 2.5 times to get the profit that they want plus 20% for that. Yes, the cost price versus the selling price is different. And like if you see that as a value of your, you're making loads per piece. You don't make loads per piece because otherwise I'd be sitting in a mansion and like I know this video is so long and if you're still here then thanks for watching. I could explain more and more about margins, profit, that sort of thing and be super transparent. I just don't think people understand how it works, how operating a business works. Do I not get to get paid for my time and effort and energy? Like I've got acne back because I'm so stressed all the time. I'm so thankful, grateful that this has become my day today. Like I'm sitting in my room, I'm sitting in a room filming a video, like not working a 9 to 5, like it's actually just mind blowing to me. Need people to understand that if you want higher quality and if you want beautiful natural fiber fabrics, if you want people to be paid, that's the price. I've made those choices and then people are like, I don't want to pay that. Like guys, everyone fucking asks for it. I deliver it. You don't want it. Love my customers. Need to find like a new audience that is like really appreciative of that price point and of the brand I'm trying to build. There we go.",talking_head,USA,False

"the 2 most common mistakes from beginner stylists .
#fyp #fashiontiktok"," Here are the two most common mistakes I see beginner stylists make when they first start out. Number one would definitely be over-complicating the outfits that they're putting together. I feel like when you're first starting now and I've done this myself, I feel the need to like rise to an expectation that's not really there, and that expectation being, oh I'm a stylist, it's outfit has to be super creative. Oh I'm a stylist, I really have to show off my taste. Oh I'm a stylist, I can't give this trait forward, answer to the certain look that I'm putting together. And that's absolutely positively not the case. In fact it might even work against you instead of for you. If you have a tailored suit, keep it simple, just go with the Derby. If you're dealing with women's wearing and trying to create an outfit for a night out, maybe just go with a simple heel. I feel like people will come across these outfits I just named and like do a crazy outside the box option. Oh it's a tailored suit, I'm gonna go with like a thong, slipper, and then throw a skirt on top of the trousers and all this, like, brought so unnecessary. Keep it simple, especially when you're first starting out and getting your feet wet into the game. With that being said, that leads me to my second mistake that I see pretty often, which is thinking the fit that you're making is meant for you. Trust and believe me, I know I've made some outfits where it's like, yo this shit is wack, this is not lit, this is not for me, and actually I'm right, it really is not for me. I feel like as a stylist you get so centered within your creativity and all these options and what you want, what your vision is instead of taking a step back and realizing that this alpha die making is for a client or a customer. Take yourself emotions out of the equation and realize that this is for a client or a customer is not meant for you to like, it's not meant for you to enjoy, it's solely based on what the customer or client wants. I really hope this helped and until next time, peace, love, and prosperity.",talking_head,USA,False
The mistakes I’ve learned to fix being a content creator.  Do Part 2?  #howtobeacontentcreator #blackcontentcreators #blackfashioninfluencer," The biggest mistakes you can make when you're being content creator and don't realize Number one, batch your content. A lot of the time people just shoot when and where they just feel like it and you get burnt out easily. Plan a day of the week and you're going to shoot, that is the day you're going to shoot everything for the rest of the week. For me when I had a 9 to 5 job for example, I would just shoot on the weekends and I would post that content during the week when I was at work. Second, lean into your personality. It's very easy to sort of follow people and mimic their ways. You want to try and lean into your own personality. If you get excited with unboxings and excited with your clothes, show that. Don't be ashamed of it. That is what makes you you. And you'll find other people relate to that and they will gravitate to you. Second thing or third thing rather, this is a time suck. Be aware that you need to set aside a lot of time for this to really be able to master it. And the other thing is, you're not really ever going to by the way. It's something you learn as you go along and you're always learning. Remember that.",unknown,USA,False
"5 things that make you look cheap

Number 1 is a wrinkle shirt. Can you wear this and go out? This makes you look on-cap, it makes you look not put together, it makes you look on-tighted. And people will not really compliment you if you are dressed like this. Number 2 is on-capped nails. If you cannot maintain your nail polish, please keep it natural, but make sure it is clean. You can't go out looking like this. It's not cool at all. Number 3 is panty-lines. This is looking very tacky. Your undergarments is not supposed to show. We don't need to see your undergarments, try and buy your colored size. So your undergarments shooting the shirt like this, it makes you look very tacky. It's not cool at all. Before it's dirty teeth. No matter what you wear. No matter how expensive what you wear is, the very minute you open your teeth and your teeth is disdirted. All your levels will just come down. Brush your teeth, maintain your teeth, keep it good or high-dent. When you smell, it smells beautifully. When you talk, people will look at your teeth and they will come. Number 5 is rusty chain handbag. When you notice that your not so expensive handbag is becoming rusty like this. Please stop using it. That's why you need to invest in quality and bags. How can you go out and your car is going to handbag? Are you going to people to regard you or call you some respects? It makes you look cheap and that's not the call for the beautiful finding.

We show tons of content tips, ideas, and editing tutorials on our page. So be sure to follow us if you're not already. Okay, so how to get this angle in this edit. You're gonna wanna prop your phone up on something or use a tripod to make sure the phone is slightly above you. I do suggest a tripod because it's gonna allow you to tilt the phone downwards easier. And then you're just gonna put the lens on 0.5 like this so it gives you that zoomed out fish eye effect. From here, you're just gonna film yourself continuously posing, dancing, whatever you want. You're some different shots and poses I think are unique and would help make the video more eye catching. And now for how to get the edit. Upload the video you just made of yourself doing a bunch of different things on whatever platform you're editing on. I'm using CapCut. From here, you're just going to split the clips you want and delete what you don't. So this clip right here, I love and I wanna make sure I have that in the video. I'm gonna split it in the beginning and scroll to split it again for where I wanted to end. Then I'm gonna delete this footage before that I don't want. And we're just gonna repeat this for all the clips that I want. Split at the beginning, split again for where we wanted to end, delete the before footage.

I mean, simply get paid for being the fashionista that I am. The first thing I'll do is leave with education and fashion tips because people love to learn, right? So I will educate the girlies on different materials, quality of clothing. I want to just do your simple get ready with me videos, although that will be one of my pillars. I will also share what to wear for certain events or certain occasions. For a season approach, I will already be posting content showing the girlies what they should wear for fashion and spoke. I would even do a series like this creator. She talks about repurposing outfits or I'll do a series like What's in My Closet pretty much only wearing what I already have put in pieces together. We also know that the girlies love affordable fashion these days, so I would do something called like styling on a budget. You know, bring my audience along for like a relatable experience, yet still being able to dress to the tee. Now when it comes to monetizing your content, you are going to make sure that you have a shot mind. You're going to make sure that you have a L.T.K. that you are linking every single outfit that you are sharing with your audience. And not only that, you must have a Pinterest, okay? If I was a girl who really wanted to make bank from her fashion content, I will have me a Pinterest and I will post pants like this. I will also share my styling videos repurposing my content from TikTok or Instagram over to Pinterest. And once again, I will be linking every single piece of clothing that I share. That way you can start getting paid through affiliate links. Another thing that I would do is like say I'm a girlie who generally loves just putting pieces together and also helping others. I will have it to where people can reach out to me for a consultation. They can ask me all questions pertaining to fashion, their body type, what looks good on them, what colors look good on them. We have it to where people can see you a budget and you can shop pieces for them. Kind of like an interior designer, but you're literally a virtual fashion assistant. Hmm. I mean, there are so many different ways you can make money as a fashion creator. Also make sure you are tagging these brands that you are wearing and your content as well because you know you have to get the brand deals and partnerships.

I would do what to expect for each season coming up I would do style and outfit with me for dinner brunch whatever I would also dedicate a lot of videos to Amazon must-have so that I came sell more on my Amazon store friend and make money off the videos I would also use the hyper on celebrities to review their outfits or well-known fashion events like the mac gala Which is coming up the point is I see a lot of fashion creators that fail to realize how many possibilities there are in this niche,outfit_showcase,USA,False

So instead of standing in front of that space, what I want you to do is have a mirror reflecting that space, a full-length mirror, and you stand in front of the mirror and film yourself there. Well, the little bit of a tweak here is that you're going to have to angle your camera so that you can't see the camera and the mirror reflection, but you what you want is you to be standing in front of the mirror so that you can see the back of your outfit, but also the mirror is reflecting that beautiful space that you've put together.

For example, if you just bought a Sherpa Co. you can create one unboxing video and outfit of the day video, a styling for three occasions video, or even styling tips. That's four posts right there. Create as many concepts from this one staple as possible. Step three, build your outfits. Start styling your one staple by creating unique and intentional outfits in congruence with your content ideas. The number of posts determine how many outfits to create. Step four, create a film shot list. Rating a film shot list will save you loads of time and will give you direction with, for each of your concepts, and have a very clear list of how you're gonna film it. Step five, film your content. Use your shot film list as a guide and capture additional creative shots that come to mind. Step six, edit your content. Edit your videos one at a time inside of CapCut. Make sure that each of your videos tells a story, and each clip inside your video flows seamlessly together. Edit your posts one to two days ahead of schedule for less stress. Trust me. Step seven, schedule your posts. Use an editorial calendar to schedule and track your content. Avoid in-app scheduling and post organically on Instagram. Stay active on the app for at least 10 minutes after posting to engage with your audience and respond to comments. And there you go. You not only have three to five posts, but now you know how to create fashion content",tutorial,USA,False
"If i were to create a fashion brand today - this is how id do it!

#marketing #branding #creativedirection"," If I were to create a fashion brand today, this is how I do it. First, I'd call it chapters where each collection or chapter has its own story, which is shown through the clothing and accessories. Each chapter is kind of like a level where based on your minimum spend and participation in brand challenges, you climb each chapter. For example, when you just start buying, you can only buy from the chapter one collection. But someone who has a big history of purchases can buy from chapter four. This will create a hype and sort of unattainable feel to the collections higher up, just like a Birken does. Each customer will have a library card to show which chapter or level they are on, and the stores themselves will look like bookstores and libraries. The chapter's fashion shows will be called readings, where the story of each collection is narrated while the clothes and accessories are shown. The packaging will look like books, and they themselves can be used as collectibles. Would you buy from this store? You know I would.",unknown,USA,False

Brand marketing in 2025#clothingbrand #fashionmarketing #brandstrategy #clothingtips #contentcreation #creatorsearchinsights," Here's how to market your brand before you launch in 2025. First, get super clear on who you're even creating for. Think beyond age and gender. Ask yourself, what do they do for fun? Where do they shop? Eat, scroll influences them. The more specific, the better. This will guide every decision you make from your designs to your content. Then you're going to dive into platforms like Pinterest or TikTok to study what's trending in their world. Not just what you like. If your ideal customer wouldn't wear it, post it, or share it, it's probably not the right direction. Next, document everything. I'm talking your sketches, sourcing fabric, unboxing samples, even when you get things wrong. People love being part of a journey, and that feels trust and anticipation before your brand even launches. And lastly, always gut check your content by asking when my customer cares about this. If the answer is yes, post-test view. When people actually see the work, the late nights, the back and forth with manufacturers, the failed samples, the wins, and the losses, they'll root for you. That connection you're building by showing up and being transparent is way more powerful than you think. It turns followers, supporters, and supporters into customers. And rest make the value of bringing people along for the ride, and the sales will flow naturally.",tutorial,USA,False
@LOEWE is really that girl when it comes to unique marketing content. Breaking down 3 social media content strategies they’re crushing! #fashion #marketing #socialmedia #content #socialmediamarketing #tips #strategy #loewe #greenscreenvideo #greenscreen," The way this marketing campaigns are the only marketing campaigns you should be looking at if you're looking for inspiration. I'm Kelsey. I run my own marketing and business development firm. They are doing three things in such a fantastic and original way. You haven't been paying attention. You should be. I'm going to show you why. I show you three things that they're doing that are so well done. If you haven't noticed, you will now. First is UGC and influencer content in a way that's original and strange. It's not your average UGC or influencer content. When it pops up on your page, whether it's on TikTok or Instagram, you pause because it's uniquely Louis Vey and it's uniquely comical or interesting. It backs up their products because Louis Vey is innovative. They're ahead of the curve. They are the cool girl. They are the it brand and their marketing just has to support what they're doing because they're the kind of brand that if you know you know. So really what they're doing is trying to bring in the right person when they find them or when you come across them, you're like, oh, wait, I've heard of them. You already know you know. And I saw this video the first time I died. I was like, this is genius. Unreal. Let me show you. And boss this bag from Louis Vey that my boyfriend got for me. I'm crying because he's so sweet and like so thoughtful. I never would have imagined that he would get me this. This is literally Princess Cheekman that I deserve. Her facial expression. Look how pretty this is. No way. Get me to put on outfits. This is so nice. I'm getting so emotional. How fucking funny is that? But also, what did they accomplish there? So many things. One, they told you it's an aspirational luxury brand. You know it's expensive because she has to treat it as an imaginary brand. Two, she said this is Princess Cheekman. Her boyfriend got it for her because it's clearly a luxury brand. Three, she made it a holiday thing. She put it into people's brains. Oh, this should be a holiday gift. Put it on your holiday gift guide. Four, she put it into men's brains that, oh, if you get this for your boyfriend or your girlfriend, whoever it is that you're going to be gifting, they are going to cry like this because this is the ultimate gift. This is a fantastic piece of marketing. And because it's UGC, it's so believable and penetrates the brain so well you will not forget this. The caption, boyfriends, please take note the holidays are coming. Fantastic. It was also shared to her page and her whole page is sticks like this. So her audience who they tapped into knows her for this and would love this content. Love it. Number two, collecting celebrities like Infinity Stones and putting them into their marketing videos, but not doing traditional marketing videos where they're like in studios, stage, high production. No, they're untraditional. They're super fucking weird actually. And when they come across your page, you're like, wait, that's true, Starkey. It's Louis Vey. But also what are we doing? What is this video about? But they are wearing the way they. And so at the end of the day, they are promoting the product, but not in a way that's like super in your face. And that's cool. Allow me to show you a few examples. Oh, that the people that they're collecting like the Infinity Stones are the people who their audience or the people who they want to draw in are interested in. Just based on the people that they are working with right now, they're clearly trying to draw in a younger audience right now. The thing they're promoting, the Aviator jacket. It's great. It's just like you can't stop watching it. Why did I watch that 15 times? I don't know. Because Drew Starkey's in it and he looks sick. But in reading the comments, so many people rewatch this because they thought that this man was a wax figure. They thought he wasn't moving. Also, super original take on the fact that so many brands are using food with marketing to pair them together. They just fucking held up the food in this in a super weird way. And that's how they took it on. But they're clearly promoting the bag. It's just, it's very unique. Like it's strange and it makes you watch it over and over again. In the comments, people are like, I watch this 45 times. It's working. And having men in particular hold up these bags, it gives unisex. They're targeting men and women. Another thing that they always do is they have them say, Louis, which is something that people struggle with saying. And it's part of their marketing strategy to have it in their marketing videos. They've done some really funny videos in the past trying to explain how to say Louis, and they just lean into it because they know what it's hard to say. This is so funny. Like, what is this outfit? And then they have the guys, the soldiers to say, I'm wearing medieval, medieval, medieval. That's hilarious. The third and final thing that they're doing is they're targeting all generations in a super funny way. They recognize that Louis, they has actually been around forever. They have new creative directors. They have new people that have come on board. They've reinvigorated the brand. And there's a whole new generation of people that are interested in it. But they've also been around for so long that there's multiple generations that are interested. So this video I thought was perfect to show that they are for everyone as long as you're going to afford it. Is that hilarious? They nailed every single person, every single audience. They're telling you without telling you, we know that you're all here. We want you to all be here. This one bag can be for all of you. That is genius marketing. It's subliminal marketing and they didn't even have to say it. That's the best part. If you just watched the video, you pick up on that. That's so well done. I think it's a good idea to do this all funny. I'm 65, I'm bleh. What a bird. What would you sound like? That was a bird. I would be a side. Like, that's hilarious. So more of the story is, Louis, there's really that girl when it comes to marketing, pay attention to what they're doing and how they're bringing characters into their world, how they're using those characters, whether it's UGC celebrity or how they're addressing audiences because they're addressing everyone. Age does not matter. They're talking to everybody. If you like marketing videos like this or deep guys like this, go to my page. I have a bunch. I post videos like this all the time. Or if you're trying to figure out how to market for your own business, go to the link in my bio and we can chat and figure out how to market better for you.",tutorial,USA,False
#foryoupage #blowthisup #fashiontiktok #outfitinspo #amadouuo," How to have a more aesthetically pleasing Instagram fashion page. First off, focus on the username and the bio. The keyword is simple. Make sure that you use the name as simple and your bio is simple. For the username, stay away from periods and underscores and for the bio, try to keep it three lines or under and don't use too many words. Second thing you need to do is focus on your posts. Make sure you have quantity and quality. Find a good balance in between. If it's a regular, fit, pick posts, try to keep it six photos or under. This makes it so that people are appreciating each photo and you're not spamming same poses. Also, if you want to quality tutorial, check out my TikTok page. Next, you need to focus on your highlights. I would recommend having three highlights or under and also keep the name simple and keep the profile picture simple. Have one highlight for your fit pics, one highlight for aesthetics, and another highlight for anything else you want. Last off, you need to focus on your profile picture and your cover pages. Try to have the same aesthetic throughout your whole entire profile. And that's how you have a aesthetic look using Instagram fashion page. If you like the video, make sure you comment, like, subscribe for me, or that, and tap the like post fashion content.",tutorial,USA,False
A big old list of content ideas for fashion creators #fashiontiktok #styletiktok #contentcreatorsoftiktok #creatortips #tiktokcontent #contentideas," If you're a TikTok creator who does fashion videos, I'm gonna give you a list of loads of content ideas and tell you why they work and give you tips on how to best use them. I fit up the day of videos. If you're a fashion creator, you should be doing an outfit of the day videos, obviously. Only if you have a nice outfit on, nobody really cares about your boring outfits. If you have something really cool, do a night fit of the day video, cut it to a trending sign, maybe talk people through it. Even better if you're wearing like a trending item, and you're talking people how you've styled it. But yeah, do your right foot of the day videos, make sure you're categorizing them properly, using the right hashtags, tagging any brands that you're wearing. Do your best to make sure that it's categorized properly. Get dressed with me. Same kind of principle, these videos like, I foot of the day videos get dressed with me videos. They provide inspiration. But if you do get dressed with me video properly, you can also provide education if you're giving any sort of like styling advice or styling tips. And also, they're really good for engagement if you're asking for audience input as well to tell you like, what shoes should I wear? Like, how should I style this? Do you like this item? What I wore this week, so whether you do this in like a video montage or like a carousel post, people love a list. The more things that you can put into your video, the better. So if you do like a full list of like, what I wore this week, cut it down like some nice music, talk through it, those will do well. Getting into more kind of specific content, but like five ways to style an item. So if you're wearing like leopard print jeans show five different ways to style them. They need to be totally different ways to style them to keep people hooked and interested and not like any other kind of videos that are like that needs to be interesting. Things that always work well is searchable content. So doing like styling tips for like X body type. So like styling tips for petite people, styling tips for curvy body, styling tips for pear-shaped bodies. Like, whatever you can do, that might be something that someone with that body type would search for. Those can be really helpful. Another fun, more viral idea is like recreating celebrity looks or like looks from Pinterest. These are always really interesting because you're like promising an end result to somebody and people are more likely to stay tuned to like, see how things turn out. Halls always work well. It's the same kind of principle as a list. Like, people love like to know that more is coming. So if you're doing like a big hall, like showing more and more items, it's like a week dopamine hit every time you pull a new item out of the bag. What's new in store videos? So if you're going shopping like maybe taking videos of things that you find new in like high street stores, these are always really interesting and tend to do quite well in terms of views and like, virality as well. Another good one for like, maybe going viral or getting a lot of views are trend forecasts. Even better if you're able to throw like something like weird or controversial in there, that will probably go more viral. What you wanted to be doing with your fashion content as well is making sure that your personality is shining through. So whether that's coming through in the clothes that you wear, whether they're very representative of your fashion or whether it's your voiceovers or the way you talk through an outfit. But one way to do it is like reading my looks from over the years. So that gives people a glimpse into like your life and who you were before you were a content creator. Similar to like what's new in stores, you could also do like what's currently on my wish list. Another fun one is like styling an item I hate. I've seen some content creators do this very well, but like finding different ways to wear things in your wardrobe that you don't necessarily like or you don't think so to you or that you can regret buying. Organize my wardrobe so like whether that's changing up for the season, maybe like getting rid of stuff showing how you put together a capsule wardrobe, people love a bit of organization. Fashion creators also have loads of opportunity to do like good series so you could do like dressing like X for a week. So like dressing like my best friend for a week, dressing like my boyfriend for a week, dressing like I don't know some kind of celebrity for a week. Again, with list videos, you could do like my five favorite places to shop for an item. So like my five favorite places to shop for jackets for shoes, like whatever it is. You could also do other lists like my favorite jeans or my favorite jackets. You could also do a video on how accessories can completely change on outfit. These are quite like dynamic and engaging to watch. And then you could also do a video on like outfit inspiration for XYZ different occasions. So whether that's like weddings or Christmas parties or like I don't know, funerals, whatever it is. But I'm going to move out of the way and I see you can screenshot these and use them for your next videos. Am I maived? Oh, hold on. You're welcome. You're welcome. You're welcome.

Whether you're showing off your signature look or helping others find theirs, there's so many ways to make your fashion your content staple...Which ideas is your favorite? #contentideas #contentcreator #fyp"," You guys, I'm back for another week of content ideas and this week is all for my fashionistas. Yes, I'm talking to all the girls and the guys that just know how to put together a look. So let's jump right into it. All right, so I'm gonna start you guys off pretty easy. Literally anybody can do this and the set is creating OOTDs or GRWMs. And if you're not familiar with those acronyms, they simply just stand for outfits of the day and get ready with me. I really love the idea of doing these type of videos because one, you already have to get dressed. Why not just prop up a camera and share the process with us. Here are a few different ways in which you can do so. I put them on the screen for you guys, but there's so many different creative ways in which you could produce these type of videos. All right, so we're gonna jump right into the second content idea and this is one that I really, really love as well and this is doing fashion halls. Now the reason why I really enjoy this because if you're really smart about this, you can make a little extra money on the side by doing this as well, by associating affiliate links into these type of videos. If you're not familiar with affiliate links are, that's a different video, but I'll tell you pretty much is you just add a link for people to buy from and you get a commission from it. I want to set up something like a TikTok shop or Amazon Influenza program or the LTK program. Doing these halls are super easy. You're already wanting to buy the stuff anyway. All you're doing is showing and promoting it to the camera. So the very last content idea I have for all my fashionistas out there is to do some kind of educational video. Something to teach us something that we may not know that you're really good at. If you're showing us some wardrobe essentials things you have to have in your wardrobe or maybe some styling tips for going on a vacation or maybe how to assessorize a bag or how to assessorize your outfit properly, something that's gonna teach the people something. One thing about it is we all know something that somebody else wants to know. Don't be afraid to share what it is that you know because again, you'll be very surprised at what people don't know, especially when it comes to fashion.",tutorial,USA,False
content creation ideas for lifestyle and fashion creators !!!! #contentideas #fashioncontent #tiktokgrowth #fulltimecontentcreator #whattopostontiktok," You're running out of ideas about it to post on TikTok. Here's some things I like to watch on TikTok as a girl who watches the love TikTok. Romanticizing little activities vlogs. So for example, like a farmer's market vlog or a morning walk or going to pick strawberries. Like romanticizing the little spring and summer things, I feel like it's just so cute and I love watching. A fashion version of that outfits to wear to, outfits to wear to a farmer's market, outfits to wear to a morning coffee date, outfits to wear on a walk, outfits to wear going to a garden. Just little things like that. I love looking at ideas because half the time, I don't want to wear just front-to-back clothes when I'm doing something cute. So I love hearing all the ideas and seeing them. One shoe five outfits. It is really hard for me to pair things together. I have a lot of shit. I don't know how to put it together. So for example, if you have a popular shoe, like a Birkenstock, one shoe five different outfits and just show different ways you would style it within a cute outfit, cozy outfit, casual outfit, kind of a nicer outfit. Show different ways. Glory tour. Especially if it's in a more affordable one because I'm not spending $200 on a fucking ring. But show me affordable jewelry that doesn't harness. That's really good. That's super cute and trustworthy. Because I always love singing. I want to wear more jewelry. I just never know what to get. So please show me yours. I'm worried about one, but I think this will be really cool. Show a vlog of you going on a night out. Like pretend it's like a YouTube video and you're like no sound over, no voice over. You're just with your friends getting ready to go out, showing the outfit, showing the music that you're playing, just the vibes that are going on. Show you guys in the Uber. Show you guys at the bar, just make it fun. I don't know why. I just like watching like real time vlogs. Like not something that's like really edited. Where to buy for blank. So for example, where to buy dresses for a vacation? Where to buy sequins skirts under $100? Like kind of listing out when it comes to finding pieces. If that makes sense, like top five places to buy summer clothes under $100. Emma Pritchard just recently did something like this to where she made videos. She showed like the first TikTok video. She was showing like whether she should wear this or this to a basketball game. And then the next video kind of lingered people to go on to the next one. She changed her outfit and asked for people's opinions on that one. And then she made another video showing the final look together. I feel like that's kind of like a cool way to really keep people engaged and care and kind of get people's inputs and kind of make videos based off of people's comments and opinions of that makes sense for like an outfit video. For example, if I was like you guys, like which outfit should I wear going to the bars tonight? This one or this one post that video. Next video, me wearing the outfit being like, okay, I think I'm gonna wear this. I don't know, what do you guys think? Here's some jewelry I'm gonna add with it. Do you guys like the shoes with the outfit? Have people come in? Then the third, the final outfit look together. That way everyone feels like they're kind of like on the journey with you. If you're going out with like a group of friends, like your girlfriends, you're going somewhere. Show everyone's outfits. I always think it's cool. I saw like one editing style was like just showing like the overhead of like the outfit, like not showing the face. And it's just showing like this girl, like all of her friends before they were going somewhere. I think they were on vacation. You don't have to cover their face or like not show their face. But I think it was cool just to show everyone's like vibe or like whoever you're with. I don't know. Make this video way longer, but I won't so let me know if you guys want more content creation ideas.",tutorial,USA,False

#contentcreator #contentideas #fashionhacks #contentcreatortips #fyp"," It can be hard coming up with ideas for content. I'm a fashion and lifestyle content creator and I have a whole list of things that I'm gonna share that I think would be good ideas or things that I've done that I enjoy doing for a fashion content creator. Creating a series is always a good idea and one of the series that I have done is recreating Pinterest outfits. So I go on Pinterest to find an outfit that I like and try to recreate it in a way that fits my style. Off it at the day video, those are classics. If you have cute outfit, share it. There's no harm in that. How to style videos. That is something that is so searchable because if someone buys, let's say for example, a mini skirt, they're gonna look up how to style a mini skirt. I mean, that's what I do before I buy pretty much anything. So having those kind of how to style videos are very searchable and will always continue to grow. A week of outfits, those are always fun because you can get five different outfits in one video or you can post them separately, but a week of office outfits or five outfits I wore this summer, those are always good videos to make. Another kind of video that I really like making is one base, three different ways, one base five ways. It basically means that you start with one base outfit, either that's a white tee and some jeans or black on black, and then you style it three or five different ways because it gives the viewer more than just one outfit and it makes them wanna save it because you're giving them more to the video when you have three different options in one video. Another good idea is just showing, basically what's already in your closet. For example, I did a video of just all my white tops because people can kinda get some new ideas of different styles of white tops or like my jean collection and then people would like see the jeans that they might potentially wanna buy. Styling tips are also great videos, any little hacks that you have or just like general things that you might think is like common knowledge, not everyone knows.

Name a better niche fashion content creator… oh wait you can’t #fypシ #fyp #fashiontiktok #grwm #streetwearfashion #streetwearinspo," I'm the best niche fashion filter on this app. And I know that's a bold clip to make, but if you look at my comments, they seem livery with me. And lately I've been seeing this whole niche to counter it on TikTok, so I figured I'd make the best niche fit on TikTok. Let's get straight to it. First of in God, these wax didn't, cause I feel like wax didn't, is it like comments, I guess, okay, kind of niche, you feel me? But even though if I count as niche anymore, like would you call 6.3K niche, like I think I'm still in the category. But back to I'm the best niche fashion to talk around this app. I know my comments might not persuade you, cause of course, some of who follows in comments are gonna like my account. But I get the coasts of people like Braden, Cam, Thrift, Loom. Just something y'all is actual favorite fashion content creators who take on fly. So I gotta be doing something right. Up next, Thundle-Lund is white button down. Now I know white button downs aren't niche. But this one specifically used to be a baggy, long sleeve that I thrifted, but I then tailored it in turn to a short sleeve. So I feel like that on its own makes it one of one niche. I don't know. That next, Thundle-Lund is tie. Now you might be thinking, mine, it's just a tie. That was that niche. When was the last time you saw someone style a tie like this though? I got this idea from St. Laurent's most recent show where pretty much all their ties were in this kind of way. So this is like a niche fire style, which I'm also putting on game. I'm putting on actual design and game, which puts you in the whole lot of the category of these niche content creators. Come on now. We all know this fit. Wouldn't be right. I thought the Loom first. Then we're gonna throw on this other jacket bath, and then we throw on the accessories. And this is the final fit. Very mean the commas went through 10 baths. I think I'm pretty fly. And this is your chance to punch a ticket and be here with a niche. Anybody's gonna catch you on next one. Peace.",talking_head,USA,True

HOW I PUT TOGETHER MY OUTFITS ✍ breaking it down step by stepcbased around a certain item/vibe makes the process so much easier & more enjoyable!!!! #fashiontiktok #fashiontips #fashionhacks #stylingtips #howtostyleoutfits," If you have a really hard time putting an outfit together or you get really overwhelmed looking at your closet every single day, this video's for you. I'm about to spell the formula to always creating a good outfit with zero to little stress. First things first, stop taking yourself so seriously. You can experiment as much as you want to in your room and no one's going to see it. You know what I mean? Like, let's just like, take a breath and release all of those sounds that are trapped in your mind. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Second of all, it is really hard to think and plan an outfit all in one go all in your head. That's why you're getting overwhelmed. Like, dash is hard. What you want to do, go in your closet and pick out one article of clothing that is inspiring you for whatever reason that day. It can be shirt, it can be pants, it can be a dress, it can be shoes, rabbits, and let that be your starting point. Really into the striped button down for some reason? I'm not going to question it. It's just going to roll with the vibes. lately I've been really loving buttoning on my color shirts just once at the top and then leaving it hanging like this. I don't know. It's giving... I don't know what it's giving, but it's giving something. Now because of the base of the outfit, I know the general vibe. I promise you everything else is just gonna flow so much more seamlessly. I'm just going Christmas shopping. I want to keep it casual, so we're just gonna put on some jeans. My favorite styling detail ever, I literally do it with every single pair of pants I own. I always put a little lacy pair of shorts underneath and have it peeking out. Okay, you see what I mean? Like that little white lacy peeking out just gives so much more intention to the outfit. Okay, we got our base, we got our pants next, you move on to accessories. Desserts are literally the most important part of the outfit. Fight me on that. So to kind of tie in the casual look, I'm gonna put on this gray beanie. I really like to layer my accessories as well. So for example, I really like the look of hats and glasses on the face. Also, if you have your ears pierced, don't forget the earrings. I promise you. Whenever I leave my earrings at home by accident, I'm like, oh, this is gonna be a bad day. Next is shoes. I'm gonna say definitely go a lot of different ways with this. That's what I mean by like, there's no wrong answer. But for me, I know I love the detail of a good chunky boot, so we're rolling with that. I've been really into bigger slaps, you bags lately. I just feel like it gives like, I don't care. Oh, fucking care. Like, these in general, I mean, you're done. I have a fully styled head to toe thought out outfit, accessories and earthing. You didn't cry for like half an hour beforehand because you didn't know to wear. Trust me, I've been there bestie and this formula, bullet proof, I'm telling you.",outfit_showcase,USA,False

#fashiontiktok"," Do you have difficulties creating an outfit? Before we start, I want to touch on what an outfit is and what makes an outfit and outfit and not just a collection of random clothes. To begin, an outfit is a set of matching or harmonious garments and accessories one together. Take note of the word harmonious. In my opinion, the clothes don't have to be matching. But the overall look should be harmonious. By the word harmonious, I mean something easy and pleasant to look at. This does not mean that you cannot wear Clashing Colors or print. I love me some Clashing outfits, especially when it's a print. Bird, even Clashing outfits have something about them that is pleasant to their eyes, which makes them work together. And this is exactly what I'm showing you how to do. Here are some reasons why you are struggling to put together the perfect outfit. Your closet is missing some essential items. A wardrobe that is easy to use is built on a strong foundation of essential items. These are the clothes that form the skeleton of your collection and of your outfit. Let me know your thoughts in the comment section. Bye.",tutorial,USA,False
HOW TO PUT TOGETHER AN OUTFIT EFFORTLESSLY #outfitinspo #styletips #swag," I used to spend hours getting ready just for my outfits look like this. So here's how to effortlessly put together outfits winter edition. One, swap your flash shoes for platforms. Unforged flash shoes are like mustard. It just doesn't go well with everything, especially in the winter. Every year wearing is bigger and baggy. So to balance it out, platforms is where it's at. You want to end out platforming up. And these are great if you go on a hinge shape, because you can actually see if they're 6' or just 5' 9"". Two, figure out what shapes and cuts look good on you. If you like baggy jeans, find a swap pair or 1 1 1 1 1 1 that has the same fit, so you will always have something that looks good on you to throw on. Like for tops, I prefer V-neck lines, so even in the winter, I reach for V-neck sweaters over regular ones. But maybe I just like V-neck because sometimes it gives the illusion that I'm not that flat. Three, wear the right bag with your outfits. When you're wearing a chill top that isn't very heavy or volumptious, wear a small mini bag. But when you're wearing a super big puffy top, opt for a medium sized bag or a crossbody bag, because it matches the proportions more. And you can actually see the bag under all that. Or get a statement jacket. Winter weather is depressing, so why don't you be the bundle of sunshine and rainbows by wearing a jacket with life? I love these two, it's so easy to throw on over anything. It makes you look really put together. The long coat definitely makes me feel like a baddie in an evil villain. I love it. Last were accessories that aren't just jewelry. I love me my jewelry, but berets not only cover bad hair days, but are so cute, they're like Cholula hot sauce, they add the flavor you need. Or you can do a headband, some cute glasses. These just do more for you than a man ever can. And instead of a regular beanie, go for like a cat mohair beanie or something, just opt for fun accessories. Anyways, now you're an effortless baddie, follow for more and follow the gram, bye.",tutorial,USA,True

"How to dress better than 99% of the population ‍↕️ 

#mensfashion #summerfashion #summeroutfits #mensstyle"," This is how you're gonna dress better than 99% of the population. Also, this is coming from somebody that wears a white t-shirt in jeans every day, so take this with a grain of salt. A hundred percent of the time, tailoring always beats chasing a trend. Like, most guys wear clothes that fit technically, but they don't really flatter their body. You're gonna eat your basics, your white t-shirts, your pants, everything tailored to your body, so it just has much for a better fit. Even the slight adjustment will make you look 10 times better. That over-accessorizing. One good watch is always gonna be way better than five cheap necklaces. Taking to a signature color palette is almost essential. You don't wanna be looking like you have the entire rainbow all over your body, unless that's your aesthetic, then maybe you do. But in my opinion, neutrals 10 times better. Choose two to three base colors, no matter how you style it, it's just always gonna look clean. And that could be an array of any color palette. I just think the neutrals look the best. Footwear is indeed the first impression. It just is. People judge you based on your shoes. It's just a fact. I read a study about it. I can't find it. I looked, but I've read it before. Your shoes look like this. One, clean them. If you can't get them clean, ditch them, get something better. They can't be great to rotate something like this shoe. First, a towel, you can wear this with a ton of stuff, and just like an everyday train or kind of vibe. And that's all I have. Follow four months fashion.",tutorial,USA,False
Fashion tips for if you don’t know what to wear… #fyp #fashion #streetwear #fashiontips #fashionadvice #mensstyle #stylingtips," Fashion tips for if you don't know what to wear. We all wake up late sometimes, check the time, and realize we've only got 15 minutes to get ready. And I mean, yeah. Sure, you could go the easy route, accept your fate, and go out completely naked. But wouldn't it be great if you had a backup plan? Well, don't panic. Here are some tips to get you through these difficult times. Match the accessories and shoes. Outfits that are too matchy can look kind of weird sometimes. It's just too predictable, you know? So how do you escape this without thinking too hard? Get your everyday accessories like belts, bags, and hats. And find some shoes to match the bag. Now what about fit you decide to wear? There is always some kind of coordination. And it's not too in your face. Save your outfits. Outfit repeating is okay. Actually, I encourage it. You really don't need to constantly be buying new clothes and wearing new fits every day. If one day when you have a little bit more time, you put on an outfit and you really, really like it. Why not before you leave or when you get home, take a picture of it? And save it to an album. This way in times of need, you can always access some good outfits at any time. So you'll never run out of good outfits to wear. Smash follow. For more riveting content.",tutorial,USA,False
how to make an outfit you actually like  #outfitideas #outfits #androgynousstyle #androgynousfashion #unisex #unisexfashion #nonbinary #outfitinspo #styleadvice #styleinspo #fallfashion #falloutfits #fashiontiktok #ootd," How to make an outfit you actually like. Pick one piece to style around. For me it's this shirt I just got from Affliction, I adore it. What kind of silhouette do you want to create? Baggy skinny, small topic pants, whatever it is we need a vision for the outfit. I want to wear some baggy jeans with this. Think about color tones. I tend to wear muted colors and I'm going to style this shirt with these jeans. I'm calling out the green and the shirt with the green and the pants and the vibrancy of the colors is pretty similar here. I'm not going to micromanage your shirt choice, but with any outfit there is a spectrum of functionality. For all the pieces. Are you willing to kill your back or your feet today? Mostly I just don't feel the need to explain some convolutive reason why one type of shoe or boot works best with any particular outfit. Try on a few pairs and pick which ones you like the most. I don't know the layer. Sure, a jacket, whatever. For me the layer is helped disguise my chest which is something that I care about as an on-binary person seeking gender euphoria. But it also just makes your outfit more interesting. I do your accessories stack. The bag and the belt might change depending on the day so too the jewelry. If you have a curated stack of go-to pieces that you cycle through and wear with everything, these things will superimpose your sense of style onto a new outfit when you put them on. The final step the most important. Do the spin. Do a little dance. Also you're gonna especially if you comment about my armpit hair.",tutorial,USA,True

I actually would guess that you have a lot of these clothes in your closet already, you just need a fresh way to style them. As always, here's a little cheat sheet, please feel free to screenshot. But basically, the girly casual style is approachable and realistic everyday outfits that have little feminine touches to them. I've listed some common girlier pieces and casual pieces right here. And the main thing I want you to know is that girly casual style really is as simple as taking those girlier pieces like skirts, dresses, really pretty blouses and pairing them with casual pieces. Jeans, tees, tanks, maybe throwing a little baseball hat, pairing a dress with sneakers. I would also suggest adding simple everyday jewelry to your outfits. Now, I would also consider adding a belt, hat, head scarf, headband, any cute little accessories just to give your outfit a little something, something. Let's move on to the outfit ideas. This outfit is what I think of girly casual, really pretty top and a pair of jeans. You can either pick a headband if you want to lean a little more girly or if you want to lean more casual, you can add a baseball hat. A cute little canvas tote gives very casual vibes. Course, a pair of ballet flats, which I personally love ballet flats very girly. I'm obsessed with outfit number two, really pretty flowy skirt, paired with a simple tank top, throw a cardigan over your shoulders or you could wear it. For accessories, we're doing a perfect blend of girly and casual, a pretty necklace with a scrunchy, some really cute sneakers, and a cute little bag. And my final outfit here for you is actually one that I've worn before because I love this outfit. I just wanna tell you about it. Love a cute little rugby top. I think there's something so kind of sporty and casual about it, but paired with a cute little flowy mini skirt is just chef's kiss, such a cute combination. Course, adding a belt and a really pretty handbag. And I love jelly flats for this kind of casual girly aesthetic because it doesn't feel too too girly, but not too too casual either. It's like the perfect blend of both. If you followed me for a while, you know girly casual is my aesthetic. This is what I like to wear in my everyday life. So this was so fun to talk about. I think the girly casual aesthetic is just perfect for us like everyday normal girlies who just wanna look cute, wanna feel cute, but just like don't wanna be too fussy about it. Every week I post a new style guide breaking down the style of your favorite celebrities, TV characters, luxury fashion brands, and overall aesthetics help you dress like your best self and make you feel so confident.

I feel like I always kind of wear the same couple shirts or whatever to church, but we were running really late. And this is kind of like one of my go-to just regular for like a t-shirt and jeans look, but the t-shirt, like the way it's cut, I really like it's a little bit different, but still really comfortable. And then these jeans, I told you guys, like just I've been taking all of my some of my bigger pairs of jeans and just cupping them out on. And for some reason it feels like a brand new pair of jeans.

So just in case it starts raining, I don't want to be stuck in my swimsuit the whole day. We're hanging out. Okay, I'm gonna wear this oversized t-shirt. You guys see me wear all the time with like my blue backershorts, but I'm gonna wear them with my green backershorts today. We're gonna switch it up. And these are from airy. They're the offline. Then they're like cross over. They're so cute. So I think this is gonna be like the perfect outfit for today. Okay, this definitely isn't what I was expecting it to look like. But I don't know. All a ton of my shorts are dirty. So I really need to do my laundry. You can't even tell, but in the summertime I have to do my laundry way more than the winter time because I don't have that many pairs of shorts. I have a lot but not that much. I'm yapping anyway. I don't know. I don't know. I was thinking this motorcycle t-shirt with this pink skirt, but now I feel like the shirt is too oversized. But I don't know. Do you think it's cute? I'm so in a size of guys. I don't know if this is cute. I'm just gonna stick with it. I'm gonna do pink vanilla and drainage. It's my perfume today. We are hitting the very ends of this perfume. Okay, I'm either gonna wear these flip flops or throw on my black sandals, but they're in the living room. So final outfit. Hope you love. Bye. Love you. Have the best day ever.",talking_head,USA,True

This is the only one that came in time and I already wore it out and you guys loved it. It's such a cute and flattering little black dress. I am obsessed with the little underscirt. Super affordable, I think it's $80 actually. Most of these are under 100. I'll link all of them in my L.T.K. Also, I am obsessed with this dress and the color is so stunning. I am obsessed with a sheer bottom. It's getting more made. It is so gorgeous. And I love when there's a mix of fabrics and make it so much more prettier in a moment for the back. This one is very similar to the House of C.V. version but it's also $70 I believe. It is such a pretty summer dress and I love dresses with corsets. I feel like it makes it so much more flattering. I think this is a keep. Also, I found the perfect summer heels of course from Tony Bianco. How gorgeous are these? Very simple, very elegant but these are so comfy. I already wore them out. This is how they look on. They're so comfortable. I am in love with this dress. I am obsessed. I love the material. It is so thick and good quality. I love the print so much. It makes it look so classy. This is definitely a keep. This one is giving mermaid. I am obsessed. I love when the bottom is see-through. It makes it so pretty. This is also a very easy dress to throw on. It is so comfortable and stretch. This one is very similar to the first dress but much more fluffy and long gone bottom. Very cute and also very comfortable material. All of these are very stretchy. This one really reminds me of the Kai Kylie brand. It's very cute and classy and you can tie this up top as well. More on the bottom. Very cute. This is the last one. It is such a fun Barbie pink color. Probably not for me. It is way too short and less than or shorter. It's a little risque. I really love the material and the pockets. They're actual pockets. They're all in the material and the frill is very beachy. Let me know which ones I should keep and which ones should go back. Let me guess.",talking_head,USA,False

"Explaining my recent outfit transformation - this is why the first outfit looks so horrible on me!!

#outfittransformation #kibbebodytypes #bodytypes #styletransformation #outfitbreakdown #outfitexplained"," Why does this outfit look so terrible on me? But this one looks effortless. The trousers are sort of mid-waist, which is a rough point on me. There isn't an in. It's just quite triangular shaped. And the one thing I'm going to do to make it worse is put on this jumper. High neck in general, they're quite sharp. So they add a lot of sharpness near the face. So if you have curve in your frame, it can be harder to do. Now with this top, it's fine because you've got the curve shown up here because of the clingy fabric. Now before I get loads of comments like no one would ever actually wear that, this is a silhouette that I wore. And this was a silhouette that was really popular on Pinterest. Kind of like a cool boyfriend kind of look. First of all, the contrast in color here. We've just got this big triangle of black here, which is no good. The waist is entirely hidden. Plus you've got that sharpness near your face. Now this jumper is not inherently bad when you haven't got all this going on because you've got an openness there. Whereas like this, it's all closed and there's no curve. It also further emphasizes that mid waist point without any waist being shown off at all. So it's like my waist starts here at my widest point. And it's just like I go straight, straight, straight, down into a triangle. A similar silhouette when Audrey Hepburn, who is a fan boy in Camine, was like really quite boyish, cool. It would look a lot more appropriate on her. Whereas this works so well because first of all, it's very fitted. The curve is what needs accommodating in the top half of my body. As well as balance. I need my lines to be very clean and symmetrical and even and not very fussy. So this collar is not very fussy. It doesn't cover up the curve and it adds around shape. It's very fitted. It's not very overwhelming. It's not oversized. It's also not too boxy. It's just a nice in the middle piece. As for the trousers, these work so much better. First of all, there are slightly different textures. They're a little bit more cropped, which honors my slightly short vertical line. They're high waist, which honors the curve. So you can see it kind of continues an allegorous shape here. The fabric of the trousers is more soft than stiff. Even though these trousers have a little bit more structure to them, they sort of blend with the softness in my body more.",voiceover,USA,False
